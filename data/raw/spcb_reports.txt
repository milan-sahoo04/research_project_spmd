Air quality across India showed significant variation during the COVID-19 lockdown period. 
Several regions experienced reduced pollutant concentrations due to restricted human activity, 
while some areas continued to show high pollution levels.

Vehicular traffic and industrial operations were largely halted during the nationwide lockdown, 
leading to a reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels in many urban regions.

Despite the reduction in traffic emissions, eastern Indian states such as Odisha, West Bengal, 
and Jharkhand continued to exhibit high aerosol and particulate matter levels.

The persistence of air pollution in eastern India was primarily attributed to the continuous 
operation of coal-fired thermal power plants during the lockdown period.

Coal mining activities and electricity generation were not fully suspended, resulting in 
sustained emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter.

Several districts in Odisha remained pollution hotspots even when other parts of the country 
showed improved air quality.

Biomass burning and residential use of coal for cooking contributed to elevated aerosol levels 
in rural and semi-urban areas.

Meteorological conditions such as low wind speed and atmospheric stability further worsened air 
quality by preventing the dispersion of pollutants.

Satellite observations indicated that aerosol optical depth values remained high over Odisha 
during the lockdown compared to previous years.

Although nitrogen dioxide levels declined due to reduced transportation, sulfur dioxide 
concentrations remained high in regions dominated by power plants.

Weather patterns including temperature inversion and low boundary layer height trapped 
pollutants close to the surface.

Combined emissions from coal-based power generation, mining activities, and domestic fuel usage 
played a significant role in sustaining air pollution levels.

Urban areas experienced lower pollution primarily due to reduced vehicular movement, while 
industrial clusters continued to influence regional air quality.

The lockdown period highlighted the strong contribution of energy production sectors to air 
pollution in eastern India.

Improved air quality in many cities demonstrated the significant impact of traffic emissions 
on particulate pollution.

Regions with dense industrial infrastructure showed less improvement in air quality despite 
restrictions on transportation.

Long-term air pollution trends indicate increasing pollutant levels in regions with expanding 
energy demand.

The findings suggest that emission control strategies should focus on industrial and power 
generation sources to improve air quality in Odisha.

Residential fuel combustion remains an important contributor to air pollution in economically 
weaker regions.

Sustained pollution levels during the lockdown emphasize the need for stricter regulations 
on coal-based energy production.

Air quality management policies must consider both anthropogenic activities and meteorological 
factors to be effective.
