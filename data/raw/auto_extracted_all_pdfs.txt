ABSTRACT environmental health risk due to air pollution. Odisha health care

degradation in our atmospheric condition. Pollution emitting from
various vehicles also cause an immense amount of pollution.
Pollutants like RSPM, SO2, NO2, SPM, etc. are the major
contributors to air pollution which can lead to acute and chronic
effects on human health. The research focus of this paper is to
identify the usefulness of analytics models to build a system that is
capable of giving a rough estimate of the future levels of pollution
within a considerable confidence interval. Rendered linear
regression techniques are found to be insufficient for the time-
dependent data. In this regard, we have used time series forecasting
approach for predicting the future levels of various pollutants
within a considerable confidence interval. The experimental
analysis of the forecasting for the air pollution levels of
Bhubaneswar City indicates the effectiveness of our
proposed method using SARIMA and Prophet model.

Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information
criterion(BIC) are two statistical measure of SARIMA model [25].
The model with lower AIC and BIC value is better while comparing
two models. Hence, the combination of these measure is used to
identify the best order of the SARIMA model for pollution

7. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
The predictions of air pollution level are location dependent.
Further, there is no previous reported work of prediction of air
pollution levels corresponding to our research location, i.e.
Bhubaneswar. However, similar types of techniques are applied to
one of the cities of Bulgaria [11]. Hence, comparison is made
between the general and logarithmic models to identify the
successful model for forecasting. The experimental results show
that logarithmic model works better at adapting to the long term
trends and anomalies in the pollutant levels. The results show that
the log-model gives comparatively slightly better values as
compared to the general model on a larger scale. Comparison of
performance metrics for SARIMA Model and Prophet Model are
shown in Table 2-Table 4.

We have also compared the performance of Prophet general model
and Prophet log model using their performance metric and
concluded that prophet log model provides more accurate
forecasting results than Prophet general model.
8. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have proposed two approaches for pollution
forecasting based on the historical data which contains information
from 2005 to 2015. The proposed model predicted pollutant value
for 2016. We made a comparison between the model’s performance
metrics. By looking into the accuracy metric values in Table 2-
Table 4, we conclude that both the SARIMA and prophet model
provides a good quality of accuracy. However, the best approach is
the prophet model on log transformation which has the least

Preface
This Taylor & Francis, CRC Press volume contains the papers presented at the International Conference on
Emerging Trends in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICETICT – 2024) held during 27th and 28th December
2024 organized by DRIEMS University, Tangi, Cuttack, Odisha, India. A lot of challenges at us and no words of
appreciation is enough for the organizing committee who could still pull it off successfully.
The conference draws the excellent technical keynote talk and many papers. The keynote talks by Prof.
Sanjeevikumar Padmanaban, University of South-Eastern Norway and Prof. Bidyadhar Subudhi, Director, NIT,
Warangal are worth mentioning. We are grateful to all the speakers for accepting our invitation and sparing their
time to deliver the talks.

which is considered very good in any standard. The contributing authors are from different parts of the globe
that includes UAE, Philippines, Uganda, Jordan, Malaysia, and India. The conference also received papers from
distinguished authors from the length and breadth of the country including 20 states and many premier institutes.
All the papers are reviewed by at least three independent reviewers and in some cases by as many as five review-
ers. All the papers are also checked for plagiarism and similarity score. It was really a tough job for us to select
the best papers out of so many good papers for presentation in the conference. We had to do this unpleasant task,
keeping the Taylor & Francis guidelines and approval conditions in view. We take this opportunity to thank all
the authors for their excellent work and contributions and also the reviewers who have done an excellent job.
On behalf of the technical committee, we are thankful to Prof. Durga Prasad Mohapatra, NIT, Rourkela, to
accept the invitation as General Chair of the Conference, for his timely and valuable advice. We also thankful to

Abstract
This paper introduces a hybrid split ring resonator (SRR)-based periodic metamaterial structure developed for a W-band
lens antenna, designed to detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by plasma or any cancerous cell. This detection enables
localized analysis of the electron temperature from the radiation source. Here the metamaterial is tailored to operate
within the W-band spectrum (70–110 GHz). The unit cell in the metamaterial structure is engineered for low loss, minimal
dispersion, broad bandwidth, and high gain, optimizing lens performance. The structure’s design, simulation, and opti-
mization were conducted using ANSYS HFSS software. A composite metamaterial (CMM) was selected for the unit cell,
achieving a near-zero refractive index to construct a low-loss, broadband, high-gain NZMTM (near-zero refractive index
metamaterial) lens antenna that significantly enhances focusing. The lens aperture dimensions are 1100 µm × 550 µm ×
250 µm.

Abstract
The objective of this study is to assess the state of air quality near municipal solid waste dumping site of the smart
city Bhubaneswar, Odisha,India. Air Quality Index (AQI) in the study area has been calculated by measuring
parameters like particulate matter (PM , PM ), sulphur dioxide (SO ), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and
10 2.5 2
carbonmonoxide (CO). Air status from AQI study depicts moderately pollution at dumping site (AQI=51.9).
Corelation study shows a strongly direct relation among AQI and PM (r=0.964). Regression study reflects PM
10 10
is good at predicting AQI (R2=0.93065, p<0.0001). Multiple linear regression (MLR) study predicts AQI with
very less error(rss=0.0003) where PM , PM , SO , NOx and CO are independent variables. This study also
10 2.5 2
identifies potential sources of pollution and the extent of air pollution. In addition, management strategies have
been proposed to minimize the effects of pollutants.

1. Introduction
In the last decades, growing population, urbanization and rising living standards have increased the amount and
diversity of waste produced worldwide (Gidde et al. 2008; Rathi 2007). It is becoming a difficult task for municipal
solid waste management (MSWM) authorities to deal such quantity of solid waste.The indiscriminate dumping of
municipal solid waste is increasing because governance is poor, environmental awareness is low and it is not
possible to install suitable municipal waste treatment facilities to handle municipal solid waste (MSW) generated
daily in major cities(Rachel et al. 2009). Some researchers from various cities in developing countries have
reported inappropriate handling of municipal solid waste (Mohanty et al. 2014; Das and Bhattacharya 2013;
Noorjahan et al. 2012; Jafari et al. 2010; Chatterjee 2010; Imam et al. 2008; Chung and Carlos 2008; Berkun et
al. 2005). Open dumping of municipal solid wastes is a pre-dominant waste management option in most
developing countries with little regard to the health and environmental impact. There are potential risks to health
and all component of environment from such solid wastes management practice (Gupta et al. 2007; Rathi 2006;
Ray et al. 2005; Sharholy et al. 2005; Jha et al. 2003). These area becoming a source of air pollution resulting
from the decomposition of organic materials and open burning of wastes which pose a threat to environment by
emitting toxic pollutants into the air.Similar type of scenario has seen in developing countries like India, where
rapid industrial growth and population explosion has led people to migrate from villages to cities, producing
thousands of tons of municipal solid waste every day (Gupta et al. 2015). Every city dweller generates between
350 and 1000 grams of solid waste per day. Indian urban areas produces 188,500 tons of solid urban waste in a
day or 68,8 million tons in a year (Gupta et al. 2015) . It has seen that to deal with such amount of MSW, the most
common practice in developing countries like India are open dumping and few times open burning at dumping site
(Sarkar 2016). This releases immense amounts of air pollutants into the atmosphere, including particulates,
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO ), and dioxins and furans.
2
The Bhubaneswar (BBSR) city is not excluded from this.The city, which was designed earlier for 40,000
people with an area of 16.84 Sq. Km of land is now accommodating about more than 8 lakhs people with an area
of about 135 sq. km. As per provisional reports of Census of India Population of Bhubaneswar in 2011 was 837,737.
Presently Bhubaneswar is generating 400 ton per day of MSW (REF). To deal the such amount of MSW,
Bhubaneswar municipality corporation (BMC) has been allotted 61.485 acer of land in village- Bhuasuni in the
year 2008 by Govt. of Odisha. The site is sorrounded by villages: Bhuasuni, Daruthenga, Tulasadeipur, Jujhagada,
Krushnanagar, sunderpada, Chandaka etc. Open dumping is the major activvity i.e.practiced for Bhubaneswar
MSWM (Mohanty et al. 2014). Some time open burning approaches is allso taking place at the dumping site to
deal the huge volume of combustible MSW (Mohanty et al. 2014; Riyan 2018 ) .It may pose threat to health. As
the human health is prone to various diseases such as shortness of breath, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, asthma,
bronchitis and lung cancer due to inhaling of such air quality around the world (Dockery and Pope 1994, US EPA

1999, Jeff and Hans 2004, Clean Air 2007). It is there fore in this study an attempt has been made to find out the
quality of ambient air in and arround the dumping site with a radious of 10Km
2. Study area
Bhubaneswar is located between 85°44' E to 85°55' E longitude and 20°12' N to 20°25' N latitude in Khordha
district of Odisha. It is situated in the eastern coastal plains, along the axis of the Eastern Ghats. It has an average
altitude of 45m (148 ft.) above sea level (JNNURM 2013). The city lies on the southwest of the Mahanadi River
and within its delta and forms the northern boundary of Bhubaneswar metropolitan area, where as the MSW
dumping site of BBSR, Bhuasuni is situated north east of Bhubaneswar city and 20 KM from Bhubaneswar
station(Figure 1).The site is geographically located at 200 23’ 30.28”N and 850 47’ 18.20”E at Bhuasuni village
and is covering an area of 61.485 Acres . It is situated in bhuasuni mouza , chandaka of khurda district having
khata no. 232, plot no. 539, 541, 543, 549 and 313. A few villeges near dumping site are Bhuasuni
village ,Daruthenga, Tulasadeipur, Jujhagada, Krushnanagar, Sunderpada, Chandaka etc.
3. Materials and methodology
To determine the ambient air quality in and around the Bhubaneswar municipal solid waste dumping site, an area
of 10 km. radius, monitoring stations were installed and examination of air status has been carried out at 10
locations (L1, L2,L3,L4, L5,L6,L7,L8, L9,L10) given in Table 1, during the year 2015.

The FP sampler SLE- 105 has been used followed by cyclonic and impactor based tech-nique for
measurement of PM and PM respectively. The sampler has been operated at maximum rate of 1.2 m3/min for
10 2.5
collection of PM particle on a preweighed Glass Fiber Filter (GFF) paper, whereas for PM the air sample has
10 2.5
been drawn through Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFE) filter paper at a flow rate of 16.2 L/min. The mass
concentrations of particulate pollutants has been estimated by taking the difference of the final and initial of the
filter paper used for air sampling.
Gaseous pollutants has been collected using the FP sampler SLE-133 having impingers arrangement (bubbler
trains) in series containing absorbents sodium tetrachloromercurate for SO and sodium hydroxide solution for
2
NO . The samples collected in the impinger were stored in ice boxes soon after sampling and transferred to a
X
refrigerator prior to analysis. The samples were analysed spectrophotometrically using West and Gaeke (1956)
method and Jacob and Hocheiser (1958) modified method for analysis of SO and NO respectively(Kartz K:
2 X
APHA 1977) . For measurement of SO and NO by spectrophotometrically, the used wavelength are 560 and
2 X
540 nm respectively
.
For carbon monoxide monitoring sample of the ambient air has been taken from the sampling tube and
injected into a gas chromatograph where it is routed from one end of the column to the other. During the movement,
the carbon monoxide is converted to methane and the sample is dispensed at different speeds to eventually separate.
The separated components are detected as different peaks in the tracer.
The obtained value of five major air quality parameters (PM , PM , SO , NOx and CO) from air sample
10 2.5 2
analysis has been used to evaluate the quality of air by using Oak Ridge National Air Quality Index (ORNAQI)
given in equation 1 (Bhuyan et al. 2010)and the recorded value of meteorological parameter has been used to draw
winnd rose diagram. Also these data has been used for various statistical analysis like co-relation study, regression
study, multiple regression study to find out the closeness among air quality parameter, meteorological parameter
and that of with calculated AQI. While regression study examines the best approach to predict AQI with the help
of single independent parameter and multiple independent parameter.
4. Result and discussion

4.1.1 Findings from Particulate Matter
Throughout the study period, the concentrations of PM found between minimum value of 38.9 µg/m3 to
10
maximum value of 71.3 µg/m3. The highest value was found to be 71.3µg/m3 at the dumping site and lowest value
was found to be 38.9 µg/m3 at the Ramdaspur. While the average values for PM at ten sampling location were
10
found to be varried between 47.15 (at L4) to 61.95 (at L1). While the recorded values for PM varies between
2.5
24.1 µg/m3 (at L5) to maximum value of 41.2 µg/m3 (at L1). The average value for PM varries from 27.95 µg/m3
2.5
(at L4) to 34.95 µg/m3 (at L1). The result indicates that the observed PM and PM value at ten location are well
10 2.5
below the standard as per national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS, 2009). The slight higher PM and PM
10 2.5
values at the MSW dumping site (at L1) has been observed due to local phenomena viz. unpaved roads, heavy
vehicular traffic, burning of MSW and heavy vehicle movement for dumping of MSW. Though the PM value
10
has increased a little but it is within the permissible limit of NAAQS which is shown in Figure 2a. It is there fore
proper management of MSW and frequent sprinkling of water are required to suppress the emission of these
particulate matter.
4.1.2 Findings from NO Pollutant
X
NO found to be minimum of 8.4µg/m3 at L5 to highest value of 13.9 µg/m3 at L8. These results are well below
X
the NAAQ standard value. Even the average values for NO also staying below the standard. The higher values of
X
NO at different location were may be due to vehicular movemments. The highest and lowest average value for
X
NO was found to be 12.55µg/m3 (at L8) and 9.65µg/m3 (at L5) respectively.
X
4.1.3 Findings from SO Pollutant
2
SO found to be minimum of 6.8 µg/m3 at L4 to maximum of 10.2 µg/m3 at L8. While the recorded average values
2
at these ten locations are varried from 7.8 µg/m3 at L4 to 8.85 µg/m3 at L8. The recorded values are staying below
the standard.
4.1.4 Findings from CO Pollutant
The study shows that CO level in ambient air is also well below the NAAQ standard. The recorded values for CO
were varrying between 271 at L2 to 501 at L7. While the average values for CO at these ten location were found
to be lowest of 310 at L3 to highest of 455 at L7.
The findings from above air quality parameters (PM , PM , SO , NO , CO) has been found bellow the
10 2.5 2 X
NAAQ 2009 standard values which is there in Figure 2a-h. Even the data of all air quality parameters at all
locations and during entire monitoring period do not exceed the NAAQ standard limits.

4.2 Results from AQI
Result from AQI from ten sampling location given in Table 3 depict that the ambient air quality is ranging from
light air pollution (LAP) to moderate air pollution (MAP) as shown in Table 4. It has seen that except location
L1and L9, the calculated AQI for rest eight locations are falling in the category of low air pollution (LAP) while
at L1it is falling in the category of moderately (MAP). Even though at locations L2, L3, L7, L8 the quality of air
is LAP but the calculated AQI reveals that the AQI values of these locations are very nearrer to the MAP category
of air quality. The highest AQI of 51.9 is registered at location L1 and next to it the highest AQI value of 50.62 is
observed at L9. The higher values of AQI were expected at these location because of higher values of observed
particulate matter concenration as given in Table 3. Study founds a lowest value of AQI (43.56) at location L4.

4.3 Findings from Corelation
Table 5 presents the correlation matrix between weather parameters and air quality parameters. Temperature ( T )
is positively correlated with NO having correlation coefficient, r = 0.0.0287. Except NO temprature is negatively
X X
correlated with other AQP parameter. The meteorological parameter, relative humidity (RH) is strongly correlated
with CO (r = 0.8112) and is directly proportional. While

the least influence of relationship has been observed with SO2 having correlation coefficient, r = 0.1247 and also
is directly proportional relationship. The relative humidity is also positively correlated with NO and temprature
X
with r = 0.4364 and 0.3766 respectively. The relationship between particulate matter and relative humidity is found
inversely proportional. The correlation study shows a significant correlation among PM , PM (r=0.768) and
10 2.5
among CO,NO (r=0.507). The tested correlation study between AQI and other observed parameter in Table 5
X
depicts that AQI is significantly influenced by particulate matter. The correlation coefficient, r=0.964 and 0.858
is found among AQI with PM and PM respectively. Except particulate matter and SO , AQI is negatively
10 2.5 2
corelated (r=-0.078, -0.042, -0.53, -0.15) with all other studied parameter ( NO , CO, temperature, RH )
X
respectively as shown in Table 5.
4.4 Findings fom Regression and MLR
In regression study when R2 value is closure to one, the prediction is better (Field, 2009). It can also be explained
as a measure of asociation between the dependent and independent variable (Field, 2009). Regression study in
Table 6 and Figure 3a-h reveals that PM and PM are positively regressed with AQI and are good regressor
10 2.5
towards AQI (Figure 3a) with regression coefficients between them: k = 0.53869 and 0.93223 respectively (Table
6). It is cleared from regression study (Table 6) that PM is best at predicting AQI ( R2= 0.93065, p= <0.0001,
10
rss=4.98). PM is also good at predicting AQI next to PM10 (R2= 0.0.73686, p= 0.00148, rss=18.91). The
2.5
regression study between AQI and meteorological parameter (T, RH, Wind speed) depicts that temprature is good
at at predicting AQI (Figure 3f). While MLR study examines the best equation between dependent parameter (AQI)
and all studied independent air quality parameter (PM , PM , SO , NOx, CO) which is there in Table 6, where
10 2.5 2
the coefficient of determination is found to be, R2=0.9999 and rss=0.0003. From MLR study (Table 6) values of
residuals revealed that the equation in Table 6 is good at predicting WQI for the study area.

4.5 Results from Meteorological Parameter Study
In meteorological parameter, temperature is ranging between 20.1o C (at L1) to 32.2o C (at L5) with average values
ranging from 22.55o C to 31.5o C. While the relative humidity ranges between 50% (at L2) to 86% (at L8) i.e given
in Table 7. The wind speed was mostly between 1.2 – 8.2 km/hour for all the studied period. The overal wind
speed during the study period at dumping site has been presented in wind rose diagram (Figure 4). The Figure
depict that the predominant wind direction is from southwest (SW) direction during allmost all studied period.
During monsoon the predominant wind direction is from southwest and south. The wind direction during the study
period is presented in wind rose diagram.

5. Conclusion
Recorded and analyzed data revealed that all gaseous pollutants are well within the permissible limit at all
locations. But the pollutant Particulate Matter (PM and PM ) are mostly responsible for detarioration of ambient
10 2.5
air quality (AAQ) which is cleared from corelation and regression study. Also the study intelligibly shows that it
would be more appropriate to consider the value of AQI instead of air pollutant content when planning for
prevention of air pollution. Based on the AQI values, it was found that the AAQ value is between LAP and MAP.
It was observed that particulate emission was basically transport related. In order to keep the PM and PM
10 2.5
values within an acceptable limit, it is recommended to grow trees with high dust trapping efficiency alongside of
roads and also water is to be sprinkled continuously at the source of particulate matter generation. Except these;
measures such as limiting the speed of vehicle in vulnerable localities, organizing public awareness campaigns
on the harmful effects of air pollution. Wind rose. A closer examination at the Bhuasuni dumping site landfill
indicates that potentially hazardous foul odors are commonly experienced by passersby and inhabitants of the
community especially those around the landfill. So further study is needed to address this.

ABSTRACT
The ambient air quality of sponge iron industries located in four distinct clusters in Sundargarh
district of Odisha, India (i.e., Kuarmunda, Kalunga, Rajgangpur and Bonaigarh clusters having 12,
13, 7 and 12 numbers of industries and a cumulative capacity of sponge iron production of 2075,
2450, 1500 and 1700 TPD respectively) were assessed in the present work to judge the impact of
various sponge iron plants operating in the area. For the purpose, monitoring of stack and ambient
air quality inside the five industries in each industrial cluster and ambient air quality within a
radius of 2.0 kms around the four industrial clusters (in East, West, North and South directions) was
carried out every week with a frequency of two samples per week in three seasons (i.e. during
rainy, winter and summer) during 2010 – 11 for a year following the guidelines of Central Pollution
Control Board. The results suggest that all the industrial clusters have exceeded the permissible
limit with respect to the particulate matter and NO emission from the stacks (PM:  106.07 and
2
NO: 96.47 against standard of 100 µg/Nm3 and 80 µg/m3 respectively). The particulate pollutants

(SPM and RPM) inside and outside the plants in all the clusters were also found to be exceeded
their respective standards (SPM:  891.23 and RPM: 284.40 and SPM:  322.77 and RPM: 138.31
against standard of 360 and 120 µg/m3 and 140 and 60 µg/m3 inside and outside the plants
respectively), but the gaseous pollutants (SO and NO) were marginally under the permissible
2 2
standards. Also evident from the Air Pollution Index (API), all the clusters both inside (API:
148.14) and outside (API:  128.65) the plants suffered from Severe Air Pollution (SAP) situation.
Hence, immediate implementation of corrective measures along with massive plantation in and
around the sponge iron industrial clusters is the urgent need of the hour.

of the seasons, the concentrations of
particulate matter, SO and NO were
2 2 found to be 106.07 µg/Nm3, 77.53 µg/m3
and 102 µg/m3, respectively (Table 1).
AAQ inside the Plant
The ambient air quality inside the plants
of four clusters has been studied and the
data is presented in Table 2. It is evident
from the table that the concentration of all
the pollutants was higher in the winter
season followed by the summer season
and rainy season on most occasions. The
concentration of particulate matters (SPM
and RPM) in the Kuarmunda cluster was
found to be in the range of 806 - 1121 and
287 - 396 µg/m3 in the rainy season, while
the concentrations of the same during the
winter season was 867 - 1352 and 297 -
409 µg/m3 and during the summer
season was 814 - 1192 and 291 - 461 µg/
m3. Similarly, the concentrations of the
gaseous pollutants (SO and NO ) were
2 2
found to be in the range of 55 - 63 and 73
- 81 µg/m3 during the rainy season, 59 -
71 and 72 - 83 µg/m3 during the winter
season and 54 - 69 and 69 - 85 µg/m3
during the summer season. Irrespective
of seasons, the concentrations of SPM,
RPM, SO and NO were found to be
2 2
1060.27, 346.80, 61.93 and 79 µg/m3
respectively (Table 2).
The concentration of particulate
matters (SPM and RPM) in the Kalunga
cluster was found to be in the range of
654 - 1035 and 245 - 354 µg/m3 in the
rainy season, 764 - 1467 and 301 - 425 µg/
m3 in the winter season, and 693 - 1198
and 298 - 376 µg/m3 in the summer
season. Similarly, the concentration of
gaseous pollutants (SO and NO ) was
2 2
found to be in the range of 56 - 67 and 70
- 89 µg/m3 during the rainy season, 61 -
73 and 75 - 91 µg/m3 during the winter
season, and 54 - 71 and 69 - 93 µg/
m3during the summer season.
Irrespective of seasons, the concentrations
of SPM, RPM, SO and NO were found to
2 2
be 1022.80, 342, 63.80 and 82.67 µg/m3
respectively (Table 2).
Similarly, the Rajgangpur cluster
witnessed a particulate concentration
1534 PANIGRAHY ET AL
(SPM and RPM) ranging from 605 - 987
and 176 - 305 µg/m3 during the rainy
season, 688 - 1162 and 212 - 354 µg/m3
during the winter season and 672 - 1092
and 201 - 341 µg/m3 during the summer
season respectively. The gaseous
pollutants (SO and NO ) in the same
2 2
cluster varied from 31 - 57 and 46 - 73 µg/
m3 during the rainy, 41 - 60 and 53 - 83 µg/
m3 during the winter and 38 - 63 and 55 -
78 µg/m3 during the summer season
respectively. Irrespective of seasons, the
concentrations of SPM, RPM, SO and NO
2 2 were found to be 891.13, 284.4, 50.81 and
69.93 µg/m3 respectively (Table 2).
The Bonaigarh cluster on the other
hand, experienced a pollutant
concentration (SPM and RPM) ranging
from 591 - 1154 and 179 - 415 µg/m3 in the
rainy season, 774 - 1551 and 215 - 513 in
the winter season and 715 - 1083 and 214 -
451 µg/m3 in the summer season
respectively. While that of the gaseous
pollutants (SO and NO) ranged from 34 -
2 2
65 and 51 - 89 µg/m3 in the rainy season,
40 - 75 and 63 - 83 µg/m3 in the winter
season and 41 - 69 and 52 - 83 µg/m3 in
the summer season respectively.
Irrespective of seasons, the concentrations
of SPM, RPM, SO and NO were found to
2 2
be 1149.40, 353.2, 54 and 71.80 µg/m3
respectively (Table 2).
AAQ outside the Plant
The ambient air quality in the four
clusters, but outside the plant premises
were studied in four directions and the
data is presented in Table 3 for SPM, in
Table for RPM, in Table 5 for SO and in 2
Table 6 for NO .
2
From the Table 3 it is evident that,
irrespective of directions the SPM
concentration ranged from 310.14 - 524.35
µg/m3 during the rainy season in the
Kuarmunda cluster, while that of the SPM
concentration in the same cluster during
the winter and summer seasons ranged
from 402.15 - 643.56 µg/m3 and 412.23 -
578.16 µg/m3, respectively. Similarly, in
the Kalunga cluster, the SPM ranged from
307.22 - 480.98 µg/m3 during the rainy,
362.11 - 532.17 µg/m3 during the winter

Comparison of stack emission and
ambient air quality parameters with
standards
Table 7 shows a comparison between the
average values of various air quality
parameters against the permissible
standard of stack emissions, whereas the
comparison of ambient air quality against
their respective standards inside and
outside the plants are shown in Tables 8
and 9. It is evident from the tables that all
the industrial clusters have exceeded the
permissible limit with respect to the
particulate matter and NO emission from

clusters, no doubt showed that the gaseous pollutant
values are well within the permissible limit, but
within the plant premises, these gaseous pollutants
were on the higher side as compared to the ambient
air outside the plants. This might be due to the
dilution effect of air driven by temperature related
phenomenon (Hogrefe et al., 2006). Similar results
have been reported by Shafii et al. (2017) in a work at
Klang, Selangor – an industrial belt in Malayasia.
The seasonal and weather impact responsible for
the pollutants accumulation cannot be ruled out in
the industrial clusters. This was marked from the
fact that the monsoon witnessed the least particulate
and gaseous concentration which could be due to
the suppression by rain. The wind direction as
described by the windrose diagram earlier might be
the possible reason for the greater accumulation of
pollutants in the north and south directions. Further,
the seasonal fluctuation of the pollutants
concentration may be attributed to the air
temperature causing dispersal of pollutants (Prati et
al., 2015).
Further, the Tables 10 and 11 reveal that, the
highest value for API both inside and outside the
plants was witnessed during winter season while
the lowest value was found during the rainy season.
The SAP (Severe Air Pollution) condition of the
ambient air quality could be primarily attributed to
the particulate matter (SPM and RPM) both inside
and outside the plants which was found to be
exceeding the prescribed standard value (500 and
360 µg/m3, respectively). The rainy season witnesses
a lower concentration of particulate matter owing to
the suppression by rain leading to low API value
while the winter witnesses foggy and dewy
condition leading to high particulate condition
resulting in high API value. Since, the API values
indicate severe air pollution condition, it may lead to
serious health hazards and hence an
implementation of a corrective measure is the need
of the hour. The present findings of high API in the
industrial area, mainly attributed to the particulate
matters, is consistent with the previous results
reported by Panda and Panda (2012) and Prakash et
al. (2017) in similar industrial areas.
CONCLUSION
Industries have a massive impact on the ambient air
quality of an area. The present study revealed that
the cumulative impacts of all the sponge iron plants
in the industrial clusters of Sundargarh district have

ABSTRACT
Being a significant contributor to atmospheric CO2, forest fires are considered a threat to the
terrestrial ecosystems that influence climate change. This study integrates in-situ and earth
observation platforms to investigate an episodic forest fire event at the Similipal National Park
and the adjacent areas in eastern India and its effect on the ambient atmosphere of the nearby
areas in 2021 March. The analysis brings out a substantial rise in the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)
during this period with apparent anomalies in carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3). The
pronounced increase in the surface concentration of PM2.5 was increased by about 12 µg m–3.
Furthermore, the AOD exhibited a spike of about 56.21% during the fire episode. The pollutants'
intensity (except NO2) was directly proportional to the fire counts, translated across the northern
part of the region. The study also employed an emission index to calculate the amount of CO2
emitted and was pressed against changes in atmospheric XCO2 concentrations retrieved from
OCO-2 during the fire episode.

intercedes the regional climate (Martins et al., 2012; Reddington et al., 2021).
Direct emissions from the plumes of forest fire not only compromise the regional air quality
but turns out to be the sources of indirect pollutants that can harm the population miles away.
This effect took the spotlight in the international forum when the forest fires of Indonesia smoked
out Singapore in September 2019 (Tan-Soo and Pattanayak, 2019). More recently, in August
2020, the Californian wildfires turned San Francisco into a gas chamber (Meo et al., 2021). Close
to home, the crop residual fires of Punjab and Haryana blew smoky air towards the south-east,
which leaves the Indian capital city, New Delhi, breathless every cropping season (Hari et al.,
2021a). With persistent fire episodes in the past years, the Similipal region has joined the club.
Eastern India is a hub for persistent aerosols, particularly due to the industrial clusters (Gogikar
et al., 2018; Tyagi et al., 2020). Frequent biomass burning and forest fires intensify the domination
of air pollutants. Appending to this, favourable topography and the meteorological conditions
exacerbate the prevailing condition. In Odisha, all these factors are harmonised. Being the
gateway to the Eastern ghats, Odisha is dominated by dry deciduous forests and provides perfect
bowls for forest fires. Due to its high hardwood coverage, nine districts of Odisha fall under highly
vulnerable to forest fire, three under moderately vulnerable and one under less vulnerable,
where 41–50% of the total population is below the poverty margin who are exposed directly and
indirectly to its ramification (FSI, 2020). It is discernibly observed that the crucial period of forest
fire occurrence in Odisha is from February 3rd week to April 4th week (Saranya et al., 2016; FSI,
2020).
With the advancement of earth observations and remote sensing, monitoring and analysing the
forest fire in real-time is utilised to its full potential, which outdates the traditional investigations,
which were dangerous and costly. Here we integrate various remote sensing platforms and in-
situ datasets to investigate the forest fire episode and its subsequent emission of pollutants that
occurred in 2021 in Similipal National Park, Odisha, primarily along with other nearby forest fire
events in eastern India. To analyse the singularity of pollution-induced by forest fire, we also
analysed the air quality from 2019 and 2020 as the background. The study aims to bring out the
impact and pattern analysis of the short-lived event of forest fire on the regional air quality over
eastern India.
2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Study Region
Being the cradle of the Eastern Ghats, the Similipal National Park is located in the Mayurbhanj
district of Odisha, India, stretches over an area of 84500 ha with a buffer of 212900 ha reserved
forest between 21°11′02′′ and 22°14′09′′N latitude and 85°58′ 41′′ and 86°42′37′′E longitude
(Saranya and Reddy, 2016). The Similipal National Park was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in
1979, as a biosphere reserve in 1994 and came under the focal point of UNESCO's ''Man and
Biosphere Program'' in 2009 (Saranya et al., 2014). The geography of the region is decked with
hills, valleys, gorges, plains and plateaus drained by many perennial rivers with mean sea level
ranging from 215–1168 m. The region distinctively experiences hot summer from March to May
(~32°C) and cold winter from November to February (~2°C) and with maximum precipitation of
about ~2109 mm from June to October. The Similipal region is recurrently prone to heatwaves in
summer and frost episodes in winter (Hari and Tyagi, 2021). The buffer zone is blended with
tropical semi-evergreen and deciduous forests (Mishra et al., 2008). Being the transitional zone,
the region ecologically links Lower Gangetic Plains (LGP), Eastern Coastal Plain (ECP), Deccan
Plateau (DP) and the Eastern Ghats (EG), harbouring many endangered flora and fauna. Around
65 villages of aboriginals are inhabited within the zone of this biosphere reserve. The spatial
domain of Similipal National Park and the eastern states of India analysed in this study is depicted
in Fig. 1.
2.2 Data Descriptor
The study employs multiple data platforms to analyse the intensity of forest fire and the
regional air quality. The datasets include multiple satellite retrievals and surface measurements
projects with various traits. Table 1 describes the characteristics and the nature of the datasets

used in the study, which are detailed in the following sections. To explicitly mark the spatial and
temporal changes in the air quality, the satellite datasets were pre-processed and filtered by
quality assurance for each time step.

the Dutch OMI NO2 (DOMINO) method (Zhou et al., 2009). For better analysis, OFFL products
were chosen over NRTI, which were then filtered by quality assurance. The errors in data acquisition
result in the missing data for the analysis period.
2.2.2 MODIS AOD
NASA's MODIS platform provides the global daily observations of AOD since 1999, which
measures the spectrum by scattering and absorption of aerosols. AOD is retrieved by 0.47 µm
and 0.66 µm, which are interpolated at 0.55 µm to report the AOD values for analysis. The level 2
AOD properties are retrieved by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction
(MAIAC) algorithm (Lyapustin et al., 2012; Mhawish et al., 2019). For this analysis, MODIS (Aqua
and Terra operational pods combined) level 2 daily Aerosol Optical Depth at 0.55 µm with the
spatial resolution of 1 km were used to characterise the spatiotemporal variations of AOD during
the forest fire over the Similipal region.
2.2.3 MODIS FIRMS
The thermal anomalies over the study region were collected from NASA's Fire Information for
Resource Management System (FIRMS), which collects the fire products from MODIS MCD14DL
of resolution 1 km, which was improvised with the integration of 375 m resolution—VIIRS thermal
anomalies (Davies et al., 2019). For this study, each thermal pixel was considered as the fire
anomaly to distinguish the spatial distribution of the forest fire.
2.2.4 OCO-2
Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) level 2 data (Zheng et al., 2020) was extracted for the
study domain and was temporally isolated from 20 February–20 March 2021 to extricate the
changes in atmospheric CO2 (XCO2) during the forest fire period. As OCO-2 was temporally limited,
which holds the revisit configuration of 16 days, a single XCO2 path was attributed for each period
(i.e., pre-fire: 20 Feb–02 Mar; during fire: 03–09 Mar; post-fire: 10–20 Mar) was analysed.
2.2.4 Surface data
Hourly averaged surface concentrations of fine particulate matters, CO and O3 at two available
sites (Brajrajnagar and Talcher of Odisha) were acquired from CPCB through the publicly and

freely available site, https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing. The
data were pre-processed and quality checked by removing outliers. CPCB uses Tapered Element
Oscillating MicroBalance (TEOM) to measure PM2.5 and PM10 (Allen et al., 1997; Cyrys et al.,
2001). To analyse and compare the intensification of the pollutants, data for the post period
(2019–2020) were selected: under stress (forest fire) and during normal conditions.
2.3 Methodology
Most of the satellite-based pre-processing and quality analyses were processed and computed
in the google earth engine (GEE) cloud platform (Hari et al., 2021a). The various targeted post
analysis was employed using ArcMap 10.3 and R Studio 3.6.1. Based on the forest fire reports
from the forest department—Odisha, the study considered the period from 3 March–12 March
2021 for satellite analysis. Furthermore, to access the atmospheric variation, the period from 9
February–16 March 2021 for in-situ data. Further, to calculate the change in the air quality, the
corresponding epoch in the preceding years (2019 and 2020) were considered. As the region of
interest falls within the buffer of four smart cities, the extent of the area was perpetuated to
state boundary for analysing the pollution concentration and exposure. AOD variations from the
satellite data were performed for the aforementioned region and averaged over the area for the
equivalent period. The correlation between AOD and fire count was investigated to explore the
spatiotemporal variation of fire hotspots and the AOD concertation. The in-situ products were
quality screened and used to analyse the change in the regional transport of the pollutants
simulated by the forest fire during the case period. Gaps in the satellite image closer to the core
region of interest were filled with an average of valid neighbour pixels by a 3 × 3 moving window.
While the rest were undisturbed as they were mainly due to cloud contamination and errors in
data acquisition. Alongside, we estimated CO2 emission during the episode with Burned Area (BA)
Index using Eq. (1), which is:
ε = A × B × β × EF (1)
where ε is the CO2 emission (g), A is the burnt area (m2), B is the average biomass load
(kg dry matter–1 m–2), β is the burning efficiency (%), and EF is the emission factor (g kg–1). The EF
of about 1613 was considered for the Similipal region, which has a dominance of dry deciduous
sub-tropical forest and was adapted from Andreae (2019). Similar to the EF, B and β was set to
3.64 kg dry matter–1 m–2 and 25%, respectively (Saranya et al., 2016) to estimate the ε during the
episode.
3 RESULTS
This section outlines the adequacy of remote sensing and in-situ observation in analysing the
anomalies in the atmospheric composition induced by the forest fire episode at the Similipal
National Park.
3.1 MODIS Derived AOD and Surface Observations
To analyse the spatial intensity of forest fire, we employed MODIS FIRMS to extricate the forest
fire situation in this region. Generally, dry atmospheric conditions associated with huge biomass/litter
load during this period trigger forest fire (FSI, 2020). The MODIS Burned Area (BA) data estimated
that the total burnt area during this fire episode was about 674.21 km2 (18.8%) with ~4500 fire
events. This introduced various pollutants into the atmosphere of the eastern Indian states.
Though fire anomalies apart from the Similipal region were observed on 05–07 March across the
whole spatial domain, we confined our fire count to the Similipal domain because of its higher
concentrations. From Fig. 2, we can infer the temporal distribution of satellite-derived AOD and
the fire anomalies across the domain, where the active fire episode event was marked from 03–
09 March. Fig. S1 represents the land use classification which highlights the forest cover for the
study domain. This was marked to bring out that the fire events were not bound to the Similipal
forest area but also to the adjacent forest areas in the eastern states. Though these fire events were
significant, they were localised and short compared to the Similipal episode.

Fig. 2. Spatial averaged MODIS derived AOD and fire count during the fire episode. The shaded region represents the active fire
period.
The surface observations of pollutants, i.e., PM2.5 and PM10 (for the stations selected within
the proximity of the Similipal National Park), exhibited a positive correlation with the intensity of
the fire events, whereas the spatially aggregated satellite observed pollutants showed a lag
correlation. Correspondingly, the AOD load over the region was spiking throughout the episode,
with an interestingly lower load on the northern part of the study region. Relatively, the southern
and the central part highlights the consistent AOD trend, inferred from Fig. 3, where AOD across
the regions spurred its spiking with fire episode. On analysing the same for the past years (2019–
2020), the pollutants load was non-substantial with negligible fire counts due to the crop residual
burning (Hari et al., 2021a). Fig. S2 depicts the surface variations of PM2.5 and PM10 for the
selected station that brings out the variations of atmospheric pollution composition during the
fire episode period across years. The PM concentrations clearly show a peak during the fire
episode with a day lag across Brajraj Nagar, whereas the Talcher does not exhibit any significant
peak during the event.

Other pollutants such as CO, O3 and NO2 exhibited a parallel trend to AOD. These pollutants
showed higher values within the proximity of fire hotspots, possibly due to their shorter life. The
difference between the surface and the satellite observations was significant but are temporally
homogenous. These temporal variations of surface O3 and CO can be inferred from Table 2,
highlighting the intensity peak during 07–09 March. Deviating from the AOD distribution, the CO
and O3 shown in Fig. S3 indicated that the pollutants were mainly locally emitted from the fire and
not transported. Though the surface data underestimate the variations in the onset of fire episodes,
the peak in the later days indirectly exhibits their validity. In the later period (from 10 March), CO
was widespread across the southern domain, which degraded the air quality considerably. Despite
the fire intensity in the mid-period of the episode, O3 was almost stable across the spatial domain.

Malda districts) and eastern and south-eastern Jharkhand (over Saraikela Kharsawan, Bokaro,
Dhanbad and East Singhbhum districts) during the Similipal forest fire event.
The spatial and temporal distribution of O3 for the study domain during the Similipal forest fire
event is shown in Fig. 5. Unlike other pollutants, O3 distribution was spatially biased towards the
north, where the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand experienced significantly higher concentrations
than Odisha. Similar to the spatial trend, the O3 was temporally lenient for the later phase of the
fire episode, where the maximum concentration was observed between 05–07 March with a
spatial average of ~0.12 mol m–2. Spatially, the highest concentration of O3 was observed over
the northern West Bengal region (especially over Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Alipurduar
and Kalimpong areas) on 06 March, with the mean concentration of ~0.12 mol m–2.
The spatial distribution of CO marginally followed AOD, where the highest concentration was
observed in the southern part of the domain with a maximum being ~0.13 mol m–2 on 07 March.
Unlike the NO2 pattern, CO was defined with horizontal (west–east) distribution, where the
western front of Odisha during the later phase dominated with moderately higher distributions
which surpassed the concentrations in the eastern front during the initial phase. The spatial and
temporal distribution of CO is highlighted in Fig. 6.
3.3 Carbon Emissions during the Event
Relatively, with the CO2 emission estimation, our results exhibit that the Similipal deciduous
forest emitted about 0.41 Tg year–1 during the 2021 fire episode. This outlines the amount of CO2
emitted during a single fire episode for a generalised forest type, but the extricated classification
of the emission level may significantly improve the estimation of pollutants emitted during the
forest fires. But then, this was generally supported by the retrieval of XCO2 from the OCO-2
satellite, which is detailed in the following section. The estimated emission quantity may vary
considerably due to the higher spatial resolution (each 1 km pixel was considered as a burnt
area). Thus, the derived estimation may not represent the burnt area in the field.
3.4 Satellite Footprint of XCO from OCO-2
2
The column-averaged XCO2 retrieved from OCO-2 during the study period is shown in Fig. 7.
Due to the limited temporal resolution, an overpass of OCO-2 across the whole study domain is
considered to extricate the changes in atmospheric CO2 composition during the fire episode.
From the analysis, it was observed that the mean XCO2 observed during the fire episode was

415.49 ppm (with maximum and lowest being 422.04 and 402.59 ppm, respectively). Spatially,
the higher and lower concentrations were distributed from central regions (in the buffer of the
Similipal region), alike AOD and CO. During the pre- and post-fire events, the mean XCO2 was
observed to be 414.56 and 415.10 ppm, respectively. On the spatial domain, the average
concentration of XCO2 within the Similipal buffer (red lineation from Fig. 1) exceeds the overall
concentration, where the observed value was 422.56 ppm.
4 CONCLUSIONS
The present study analysed the influence of the 2021 Similipal forest fire episode on the
distribution of atmospheric pollutants over the eastern states of India. With the earth observation,
the burnt area was estimated to be 674.21 km2 (18.8%) with ~4500 fire events. This fire episode
injected various air pollutants, further degrading the air quality of eastern India. Our study also
draws inference in understanding the regional carbon emissions emitted through forest fires in the
study area with the emission factor. The results indicated that the fire episode induced pollutants
climbed (CO and O3: 4 mg m–3) significantly that mostly dominated the southern region of the
domain, where they reached a maximum on 04 March. Similarly, the CO2 emitted from the episode
was estimated to be 0.41 Tg year–1. For the aerosols, AOD and PM concentrations were increased
precipitously (~18 µg m–3) after 06 March, signifying the massive load of aerosols emitted from the
fire episode. In contrast to other pollutants, NO2 anomalies are considerably lower with little change
in the spatial aspect. Similar to AOD, the XCO2 concentration was distinct for the fire episode.
Although, we anticipate that the actual emission was larger than the represented due to other
active fire zones. AOD dominates the spatial distribution of the other pollutants, where the Similipal
forest fire episode possibly threatens the air quality across the eastern states. In light of that,
smoke from the fire has reduced the visibility considerably. Due to the strapping wind pattern,
the smoke from the Similipal fire would have compromised the air quality of major cities (Rourkela,
Bhubaneshwar, Kharagpur, etc.) of the states. However, the absence of real-time monitoring stations
in these cities impedes the better monitoring of short-lived pollutants to gauge the impact. But
then, the overall picture of this study is clear that the seasonal fire episodes in the Similipal
domain push the air quality in Odisha beyond its limit. The present case study helps to understand
the expansion of very poor air quality at a regional scale initiated by the forest fire events for a
shorter period over eastern India, which demands the exigency of the establishment of a proper
in-situ network to fill the void in the scientific understanding on the life cycle of such pollutants.

ABSTRACT
Considering the need to identify the sources of air pollution in smart city Bhubaneswar, a
non-attainment city in India, a high-resolution comprehensive gridded emission inventory (EI) of
eight primary air pollutants has been developed for the base year 2018. The inventory involves
detailed activity data with ~0.4 km × ~0.4 km resolution covering the city using a Geographical
Information System (GIS) based statistical approach. In total, ~17 major and minor sectors are
responsible for the city’s air pollution crisis. Windblown road dust, transport sector, and residential
cooking activities emerged as the dominating sources. Emissions of CO, NOx, SO2, VOC, PM2.5, PM10,
BC, and OC are estimated to be 112 Gg yr–1, 44 Gg yr–1, 11 Gg yr–1, 73 Gg yr–1, 9 Gg yr–1, 17 Gg yr–1,
5 Gg yr–1 and 0.8 Gg yr–1 respectively. Nearly 14% and 12% area of the entire study domain are
found to be responsible for almost half of PM10 and NOx emissions respectively. The central region
of the city with the presence of national highways, major roads, and nearby industrial belts,
experiences maximum emission of pollutants. The present gridded surface emission dataset is an
OPEN ACCESS
essential requirement in framing new mitigation strategies to combat ongoing and future air
pollution crises and achieve better air quality.

of socio-economic growth. Being a developing nation, Indian cities are also undergoing the problems
of increasing urban settlement, industrial emissions, vehicular traffic, waste burning, etc. As
evidence, 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities are belonging to India and the nation has
occupied the third position based on annual average PM2.5 concentration (IQAir, 2020). Although
cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata are always at the center of attraction regarding
poor air quality, the air quality in smart city Bhubaneswar is neither in good terms for which the
National Green Tribunal of India has declared the city as one of the non-attainment cities under
the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). Target of the NCAP is to reduce PM levels by 20–30%
by 2024, for which identification of sources of pollutants and understanding their corresponding
share in the city’s total pollution load becomes essential. Level of suspended particulate matter
in the city’s air has failed to maintain the national ambient air quality standards that were defined
by the CPCB. The Air Quality Life Index (Suman, 2019) by Chicago University suggests that life
expectancy of residents in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar can be 2.7 years longer if their air quality
meets the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.
Although there are a number of studies focusing on the measurement of major air pollutants
in Bhubaneswar, none of them represents a detailed emission inventory that highlights the
comprehensive listing of sources of air pollutants and their magnitude. Few studies individually
focus on concentration of specific pollutants and their relationship with meteorological conditions
with the help of backward trajectory and statistical analysis (Mahapatra et al., 2012; Nath et al.,
2021; Panda et al., 2021, 2016). A report published by Odisha State Pollution Control Board focused
on the ambient air quality status of Odisha from 2006 to 2014. Rout et al. (2012) analyzed the
status of ambient air quality in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. Rout (2018) links land use change with
the air quality of Bhubaneswar. Most of these studies have addressed the concentration of air
pollutants with meteorological phenomena. However, requirement of spatially resolved high-
resolution gridded emission inventory has not been fulfilled yet which would be very essential
for designing air-pollution-control measures. Moreover, the unavailability of a gridded surface
emission data set limits the air quality modeling study too. Therefore, the initial and foremost
step towards mitigation of air pollution begins with a comprehensive study on the identification
of both attended and unattended sources and their quantification through an established
approach. Accurate quantification of emissions of various pollutants is challenging due to lack of
source-specific reliable activity data for Bhubaneswar. Usage of primary data in development of
an emission inventory makes it more authentic and reliable but its collection is a tough task and
requires financial as well as human resources along with the support of local people.
Hence, an attempt has been made to quantify the emissions of major primary air pollutants from
all possible major and minor sources with a high-resolution gridded (~0.4 km × ~0.4 km) emission
inventory over smart city Bhubaneswar in Eastern India. The paper is unique in many ways by
introducing a detailed surface-emission dataset for the base year 2018 including 17 sectors
focusing on eight primary pollutants which are- particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC),
black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC). This is the very first ever high-resolution gridded emission
inventory for Bhubaneswar that involves activity data from both primary sources by field survey
during the pre-pandemic time and secondary sources. The outcomes of the study would play a
vital role in planning mitigation strategies and policies for the improvement of air quality by
reducing the pollutant load in the city.
2 METHODS
2.1 Study Area
Bhubaneswar, popularly known as the city of temples, is located between 20.27°N and 85.84°E
with an average altitude of 58 meters in the Khordha district of Eastern Odisha as shown in Fig. 1.
With an area of 186 km2 and an average population of 1.1 million in 2018, it falls under the
jurisdiction of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC, 2022). Being the capital of the state,
the city has emerged as one of the fast-growing commercial hubs with administrative, information
technology, education, and tourism advantages. As per the national smart cities mission of the

Fig. 1. Area of interest.
Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Govt. of India, smart cities are those where citizens have a
decent lifestyle with the availability of smart solutions, core infrastructure, and a clean &
sustainable environment. In 2016, Bhubaneswar is chosen to be one of the smart cities and it is
the only Indian city among the world’s top global smart cities as listed under the Global Smart
City Performance Index by Juniper Research (2017). Apart from this, the study area holds a
strategic position in India, as most of the polluted air mass from the Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP),
and the heavily industrialized Chhota Nagpur Plateau region as well as the western part of India,
reaches the Bay of Bengal via this route (Mallik et al., 2019; Sahu et al., 2019).
2.2 Sources of Air Pollution in Bhubaneswar and Activity Data Collection
At present, 17 major and minor sectors have been considered, which are rearranged into five
major sectors. Activity data for individual sources have been obtained from primary as well as
authentic secondary sources. The objective of primary data collection was to generate unavailable
data sets and to improve the accuracy and reliability of inventory by confirming the authenticity
of previously available data. More than 20 students from Utkal University were involved to carry
out field campaigns from January to May 2018. Primary activity data for sectors like slum,
residential, transport and street vendors, etc. are collected along with available secondary data
from published official reports and governmental sources. At the same time, the assembled primary
data are checked for quality before incorporating them for emission estimation. Sector-specific
collected primary and secondary datasets along with their sources are presented in Table S1.
2.2.1 Road transport
Parameters used to estimate the emissions from transport sector are presented in Table 1,
which includes number of vehicles, fuel type, and Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT) per day with
respect to vehicle category. A mounting dependence on the usage of private vehicles has been
observed, as nearly half of all households in the city own two-wheelers and 11% own cars (OLA
Mobility Institute, 2018). In the present study, the whole road transport system is broadly classified

into eight categories of vehicles, which are Two-wheelers (2W), Three-wheelers (3W), Buses,
Personal Cars (P Car), Commercial Cars (C Car), Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV), Light Commercial
Vehicles (LCV), and Multi-utility vehicles (MSLV). Percentage contribution of different vehicles is
illustrated in Fig. 2(b). From registered vehicle data analysis, it is found that around 15% of
vehicles are older than 15 years and emit high amounts of pollutants. In 2018, Bharat Stage-IV
norms were made mandatory by Govt. of India to regulate the emissions of air pollutants released
from motor vehicles. As per this rule, the emission standard of pollutants with respect to each
vehicle category was set and the Worldwide Harmonized Motorcycle Test Cycle (WMTC) was
made compulsory for vehicles registered after 2017 (ICCT, 2014). Despite this, a number of older
vehicles registered before this period are still moving on roads even after the phasing-out procedure.
Since driving pattern of each vehicle category varies significantly with urban conditions, hence
kilometre travelled by individual vehicle category also plays an effective role to determine pollution
load linked to vehicular exhaust. Therefore, vehicle kilometres travelled per day (VKT day–1) as
well as fuel type were adopted from the primary data collected during field campaigns held in
Bhubaneswar.
During the transport survey, vehicle density and types of vehicles at various traffic junctions
and busy roads across the city have been counted using click counter devices for 30 days, which
includes both weekday and weekend scenarios. During survey, 33 locations on major roadways
were taken for vehicle counting across the city, illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The survey locations were
chosen based on road types, road congestion due to vehicular density, major busy routes to
various marketplaces, educational institutions, temples, hospitals, hotels, and residential areas
etc. Fig. 2(a) represents the vehicle density over these roads of Bhubaneswar. Nakhara Square,
which connects Bhubaneswar and its twin city Cuttack, experiences maximum vehicular density.
In addition to this, some other busy roads due to the presence of major offices, schools, railway
stations, shopping malls, and temples in nearby regions include Acharya Vihar road, Jaydev Vihar
road, Fortune tower road, RMRC road, Patia road, Ram Mandir road, etc.
2.2.2 Wind-blown road dust
Although Bhubaneswar is a planned city, the dust load on both major and minor roads is high
due to a lack of proper maintenance that aggravates dust resuspension due to vehicular movements.
In addition to that, most two-wheelers prefer to drive on unpaved shoulders of the roads,
especially during traffic hours. Based on digitization of the existing road networks, the city has a
total road length of ~1170 km, which includes ~904 km of minor roads, ~214 km of major roads,
and ~52 km of national and state highways. However, conditions of the roads are down-and-out,
due to which re-suspended dust from both paved and unpaved roads, driven by increasing vehicular
movement, holds a major share of PM concentration in the air. Lack of proper maintenance and
ongoing road and over-bridge constructions along the roads of Mancheswar, Old town, Kapila
Prasad, Khandagiri, etc., have been experiencing high dust loads. Moreover, vehicle-induced road
dust is directly proportional to the density of vehicles plying, their average weight, and mean
speed. Besides that, amount of silt load on roads, average precipitation days, soil moisture content,
etc., also act as modulating factors. All these factors used to estimate the emission load, are
briefly tabulated in Table S1.

2.2.3 Industry
Bhubaneswar has become one of the fast-growing, major trading and commercial hub in
Odisha and Eastern India. As per the report of the ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
(MSME, 2022), 2019–20, there are 21,546 registered industrial units in the Khordha district.
According to the CCIPL (2006), there are about 88 industries comprising three large-scale, 34
medium scale and 51 small-scale industrial units operating majorly in the four industrial estates of
Bhubaneswar namely Rasulgarh, Mancheswar, Chandaka Nuclear Industrial Complex (CNIC),
Bhagabanpur and other regions. Industrial sector in the city includes steel, paper, automobile,
pharma, food, electronics industries, and others. Most of the small-scale industries operating
inside the city fall under unorganized sectors that do not have necessary pollution control
measures and with a pollution impact potential of a 2–5 km radius. Fuel usage pattern in the
industries is highly uncertain because of the unavailability of a systematic database for fuel used
by individual industries, so the fuel consumption pattern is adopted according to the national
average. The domain selected for the study does not include any thermal power plants hence
this sector has not been considered for emission estimation.
2.2.4 Residential
Emissions from households, Slums, Street Vendors, and Diesel Generators have been included
in this sector. The sub-sector ‘Household’ represents emission of various pollutants from cooking
activities of urban population. According to the reports of census India, population of the city
was ~8 lakh in 2011 with an average of 2.53% increase per year (India Census, 2011; Population
Census, 2011). Hence, the total population of Bhubaneswar is ~1.1 million with a 3% increase
from 2017 (UN DESA, 2019). Since 1/3rd of the total population resides in slum areas (CCIPL, 2006),
rest of the urban population was found to be ~7 lakhs with an average household size of four per
family. On the other hand, a slum represents a poorly built congested area having a minimum of
300 population or about 60 to 70 households in unhygienic surroundings, usually with inadequate
infrastructure that lacks proper sanitary and drinking water facilities (Rout, 2008). Approx. 835
households and 537 slums were surveyed in major residential areas of Bhubaneswar including
Sahid Nagar, Kharavel Nagar, Chandrasekharpur, Patia, Nayapalli, Khandagiri, Salia Sahi, Dumduma
Bhoi Sahi, Sriram Nagar, Behera Sahi, Nilachakra Nagar, etc. A structured schedule was prepared
to interrogate the head of each selected household for enquiring about the type and quantity of
fuel they use for cooking activities.
Cooking activities of roadside eateries, dhabas, fast food stalls, hotels, restaurants, and other
street vendors also hold a significant share in contributing to urban air pollution. Because of the
increasing demand and a sustainable source of income, people in urban areas especially the poor
and slum dwellers have been opting more towards street vending. According to the president of
the All Odisha Roadside Vendors’ Association, there are more than 22,000 vendors across the
city (Kumar, 2012). It has been assumed that nearly 60% of the total vendors earn their livelihood
by selling different fast foods and being involved in other cooking-related activities. During the
field survey, activity data from 980 street vendors, hotels, and restaurants were collected. The
type and quantity of cooking fuel, opening hours and peak seasons of business, type of oil used
and cooking duration, etc. were thoroughly observed and enquired from the vendors. Information
obtained from the field survey regarding the cooking activities practised by slums and other
households, hotels, and street vendors of the city has been given in Table 2. The collected values
are crosschecked with other studies (Das and Pal, 2019; Dash, 2015).
Apart from the cooking activities, this sector also addresses emissions from diesel generators
(DG) which are used as a power backup in many shopping malls, restaurants, hotels, hospitals,
theatres, residential complexes, etc. Considering the lifestyles of the city’s population, it has been
assumed that at least 10% of urban households use DG sets as a backup plan. Each year ~9000–
12000 liters of diesel is consumed by a standardized 12–25 kWh diesel generator used in telecom
towers (Sahu et al., 2015). In the city, the DG sets run at least for an hour per day.
2.2.5 Others
The other sector comprises sub-sectors like aviation, open waste burning, construction dust,
incense sticks, mosquito coils, cigarettes, and crematoriums. Emission from ‘aviation’ is calculated

based on Air Traffic Movements (ATM). The only international airport of Odisha that is the Biju
Patnaik International Airport (BPIA) is located just 3 km away from Bhubaneswar city Centre. Due
to a significant number of national and international events including the Men’s Hockey World
Cup organized in Bhubaneswar, the BPIA achieved a whopping four million annual passenger
traffic in the fiscal year 2018–19. As per the BMC portal, the city generates approx. ~520 tons of
solid waste per day. The collected Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) from various parts of the city
are transferred to the Temporary Transfer Station (TTS) near Sainik School. Later, these wastes
are transported to the dumpsite located at Bhuasuni in Daruthenga every year (Times of India,
2019). Since this area remains outside the study domain, emission from dumpsites has not been
considered for the city. According to the CPCB (2019), 2018–19, there is no Waste to Energy (WTE)
plant in Odisha.
With rapid urbanization and numerous construction activities like roads, flyovers, apartments,
multi-complexes, building blocks, etc., Bhubaneswar has been experiencing a bulk amount of
suspended dust from construction activities. Transfer of construction materials and debris released
from land clearing and demolition through multi-utility vehicles like trucks, tractors, bulldozers,
scrapers, compactors, etc., increase the amount of dust load in air. Maximum numbers of brick kilns
are located outside the selected city domain, hence emission from brick industries has not been
considered for our study. Emissions from the crematory grounds hold a major share in polluting the
air, especially in the local areas. Although many cities are opting towards an electrical cremation
system, the traditional Hindu funeral pyre system that is burning dead bodies is still effective in
Bhubaneswar. There are at least 15–20 crematorium grounds in Bhubaneswar where traditional
burning is preferred. Bhubaneswar, famous as the city of temples, has around 700 temples located
all over the city, specifically in the old town region. Apart from that, major population uses
incense sticks and diyas as a traditional approach. Besides households, street vendors also use
incense sticks to worship at the time of opening their business every day. Use of mosquito coils
by households particularly by slum dwellers is another emitter of indoor air pollution. Usage of
these coils increases in rainy seasons due to the breeding of mosquitoes in unhygienic water
logging conditions. Similarly, smoking tobacco and cigarettes also remains a source of pollutants.
The chemical composition of incense sticks, mosquito coils, and tobacco has been collected from
previous studies (Cohen et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014). Fig. 3 demonstrates the spatial location
of the major emission sources over Bhubaneswar.
2.3 Methodology Used
For developing the emission inventory, a “bottom-up” approach has been adopted over the
widely used “top-down” approach in order to improve the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty of

inventory. The accuracy of emission estimated depends on two major components i.e., Emission
Factor (EF) and activity data. Activity data used in this study has been generated during the field
survey. EF is the representative value of a pollutant released into the atmosphere with an activity
associated with release of that pollutant. EF varies for each sector depending upon the mode of
combustion, fuel type and chemical composition, usage pattern, emission control device, etc. Apart
from this, EFs also differ from region to region because of the different meteorological parameters
and climatic conditions. These experiment-based values are taken from several research articles
and reports keeping the Indian city scenario in mind and have been listed in our recent studies
(Mangaraj et al., 2022a, 2022b). For estimating vehicular emission, EF developed by the Automotive
Research Association of India (ARAI) and the value published by our previous studies (Sahu et al.,
2020, 2021a, 2021b), have been used. The equations used to estimate the emission are similar
to that adopted by Klimont et al. (2002), and in our previous works (Sahu et al., 2011, 2014, 2021b).

Eq. (1) represents the generalized formula, which is used for estimating emissions from all
other sources except the sectors like road transport and wind-blown road dust. Emissions from
road transport are estimated as per Eq. (2) due to technology-specific vehicular emission factors
derived by ARAI (2007) and CPCB (2010). Since the sector wind-blown road dust considers some
important modulating factors; hence, Eqs. (3–4) are used for estimating emissions due to vehicular
movement on paved and unpaved roads respectively.

After estimation, the emission is distributed spatially over the selected area of interest using
the tools from Geographic Information System (GIS). For gridding of the emission values with
respect to our required resolution, different proxies have been incorporated to improve the fine
spatial resolution. Layers of road networks including state and national highways, and minor and
major roads have been created for the distribution of emissions from re-suspended road dust
and the transport sector. For residential sectors, region-specific population density, urban spread
of the grid, and for other sectors, major points of interest like the locations of market complexes,
hospitals, hotels, street vendors, temples, residential blocks, and commercial zones are used as
a proxy to spatially assess the emissions. Emissions from industries are allocated to the specific
grids where the major industrial clusters are present. Comprehensively, Bhubaneswar city’s
geographical region is covered by 848 grid cells, each having a resolution of ~0.4 km × ~0.4 km.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the present study, emission inventories of gaseous pollutants such as CO, NOx, SO2, and VOC
as well as particulate matter PM2.5, PM10, BC, and OC have been developed at a fine resolution of
(0.4 km × 0.4 km), which incorporated all possible major/minor sources over Bhubaneswar in 2018.
The estimations for CO, NOx, SO2, VOC, PM2.5, PM10, BC, and OC are found to be 111.58 Gg yr–1,
44.41 Gg yr–1, 10.58 Gg yr–1, 72.84 Gg yr–1, 8.89 Gg yr–1, 16.51 Gg yr–1, 4.61 Gg yr–1 and 0.83 Gg yr–1

respectively. Since this is the first-ever developed emission inventory for Bhubaneswar, no
comparison with previous studies has been done. The pollutant-specific share of different
sub-sectors is provided in Table 3.
3.1 Spatial Distribution and Sectoral Contribution
After a brief analysis, it is found that emission distribution of the above eight pollutants is more
or less equivalent because of the similar emitting sources. Because of space limitation, spatial
distribution of one particulate pollutant (i.e., PM10) and one gaseous pollutant (i.e., NOx) have
been elaborated here focusing on their source in a comprehensive manner.
3.1.1 Particulate pollutant (PM )
10
Fig. 4(a) illustrates the spatial distribution of total PM10 emission (17.3 Gg yr–1) and its relative
contribution from all sectors. Maximum PM10 emission was found to range between 100–157
tons grid–1 yr–1, which is prominent over the areas having national highways and major traffic
roads. On the other hand, the least emission having a range of 10–30 tons grid–1 yr–1 is spatially
scattered along the peripheral zones of Bhubaneswar that have minimum urban settlement and
less vehicular movement due to presence of the Chandaka forest and many rivers like the Daya,
the Kuakhai, etc. It is observed that 50% of PM10 comes from only ~14% area of Bhubaneswar. Some
of the PM10 hotspots are confined over areas like Rasulgarh, Unit-9, Unit-3, Laxmisagar, Unit-4,
Gajapati Nagar, Nayapalli, Khandagiri, Mancheswar, Patia, and Chandrasekhar, etc., which were
precisely demonstrated in Fig. 5. The grid having the maximum emission of ~157 tons grid–1 yr-1
is located in the Eastern region of the city i.e., Rasulgarh area. Major contribution to PM10 in this
area comes from the transport sector. With the presence of the Kolkata-Chennai National Highway
and Cuttack-Puri by-pass junction, Rasulgarh becomes one of the busiest roads in the city. In addition
to that, the area is an inlet towards Bhubaneswar hence, many other district vehicles along with
passenger buses travel across this area. The second highest PM10 emission peak is observed at
Bhoinagar, Unit-9 with ~130 tons grid–1 yr–1 that majorly comes from resuspended road dust followed
by vehicular emissions. Unpaved shoulders of roads in this area and heavy traffic rush contribute
to the emission of PM10. Kharvela Nagar, Unit-3 occupies the third position among the hotspots with
~128.4 tons grid–1 yr–1 of PM10 emissions in which road dust and residential cooking activities play
the dominant role. Being nearby to the railway station, Mo Bus stand, and major offices, the road
experiences a large number of vehicular activities even at the odd time of the day. In addition to
that, selling food items and cooking activities of many roadside street vendors emit PM10 in this
area. The region with a large number of roadside dhabas, street vendors, and fast-food stalls is
found to be the Laxmisagar region with an approx. emission of ~128.2 tons grid–1 yr–1. Usage of
large amounts of coal and wood as cooking fuel especially by the food vendors makes the area a
dominant source of PM10 from the residential sector. Patia region also has the residential sector
as the highest emitter of PM10 because of the usage of solid fuels in cooking activities of many hotels,

street vendors, and slum dwellers of Prasanti Vihar, Damana Hata Basti, Patia Jali Munda Sahi, CS
Pur Sabar Sahi, Sikharchandi clusters, etc. Other slum pockets of Bhubaneswar such as Salia Sahi, Dum
Duma, Khandagiri, and BDA colony also contribute to PM10 emissions of ~120 tons grid–1 yr–1 through
their domestic cooking practices and biomass burning. The area of Nayapalli and Mancheswar having
many unorganized small industrial clusters and high vehicular movements tend to contribute a
significant load of PM10 (~120 tons grid–1 yr–1). A large number of HCVs and LCVs carrying raw
materials and industrial goods over the unpaved roads of these areas particularly of Mancheswar
Industrial estates increase wind-blown dust events in an impactful manner. Average weight of
heavy and light commercial vehicles used to carry heavy goods in poor road conditions triggers
vehicular exhaust emission. Apart from that, major roads like Vani Vihar road, Ashok Nagar Road,
Unit-4 road, Gajapati Nagar, Khandagiri road, Chandrasekharpur road, and Nayapalli road also
carry a significant load of PM10 (~100–122 tons grid–1 yr–1) because of the high volume of traffic
and suspended road dust. The sector-specific PM10 contribution is plotted in Fig. 4(b).
The gridded PM10 emission from major sectors was plotted separately in Fig. 6, from which the
emission distribution could be recognized spatially. The five major sectors considered here are-
transport sector which contributes ~4.7 Gg yr–1 as illustrated in Fig. 6(a), re-suspended road dust
~5.1 Gg yr–1 (Fig. 6(b)), industries ~0.8 Gg yr–1 (Fig. 6(c)), the residential sector with ~4 Gg yr–1
(Fig. 6(d)) and the other sector with ~3.4 Gg yr–1 of PM10 load (Fig. 6(e)). Current study indicates
that wind-blown road dust contributes to maximum PM10 emission due to high silt loading along
major roads. Fig. 6(b) illustrates that the national highways and major roads bear PM10 emissions
with the range from ~20–45 tons grid–1 yr–1. Roads having heavy traffic congestion include Vani
Vihar road, Rasulgarh Square, Acharya Vihar road, Kharabela Nagar road, Kalpana square, etc. Heavy
traffic congestion by commercial vehicles contributes ~28% to total PM10 emissions. Therefore,
it can be said that slow-moving traffic along with road condition triggers emission load and cause
degradation of urban air quality.

Spatial distribution of total NOx emission (44.4 Gg yr–1) and its relative contribution from all
sectors in Bhubaneswar has been shown in Fig. 7. Since vehicular exhaust contributes a major
amount of NOx, the central region of the city shows the maximum NOx emission in the range of

~160–2270 tons grid–1 yr–1 due to the presence of dense road network including national highways
and major roads. Total emission of NOx from the transport sector is ~36 Gg yr–1, which is the highest
among all the sectors. The areas including Airport road, Rasulgarh, Mancheswar, Unit-3, Unit-9,
Gajapati Nagar, Unit-4, Khandagiri, Laxmisagar, Kalpana Square, Patia and Chandrasekharpur with
a large number of vehicular activities become the dominant contributors of NOx with ~0.3–2 Gg yr–1
emission. As aviation sector holds a significant share of NOx emissions (Freeman et al., 2018), so
one of the hotspots is also found to be at the airport road. Industrial emission is the second
highest contributor of NOx with an average emission of ~2 Gg yr–1. Therefore, the eastern region
of the city including Rasulgarh and Mancheswar area is found to be among the high emitters of
NOx due to the presence of many medium and small-scale industries. Residential sector including
cooking activities by the slum localities, street vendors, etc., and the emission from diesel generators
together contribute ~3.5 Gg yr–1 to the total NOx emission. Surprisingly, it has been observed that
only 12% of the grid holds a share of 50% of NOx emissions in the city. The sector-specific NOx
contribution is demonstrated in Fig. 7(b), which shows that transport is the highest contributor
(~81%) to total NOx. With high vehicular movements of personalized and aging vehicles specifically
two-wheelers and cars, this sector remains the dominating one. Since the combustion of diesel
emits more amount of NOx (Sahu et al., 2012), the emission from diesel generators stands as the
second highest contributor with ~5.3% of total NOx emission.
3.2 Uncertainty
In our study, we have incorporated data from primary sources followed by secondary sources.
Data collected from the local people varies from person to person. At the time of inquiry, they
usually do not give accurate data either knowingly or unknowingly. Although secondary sources
of activity data are collected from authentic government sites, city-specific data might remain
uncertain up to a few extents. Here, we have followed the Monte Carlo error propagation simulation
and mean deviation method for detailed category-wise uncertainty estimation (Paliwal et al.,
2016). The factors like (a) Emission factors, (b) Activity data, (c) Proxy information, (d) approximated
data gaps, (e) Efficiency of controlling equipment, etc. has been considered for uncertainty
estimation of all the sectors. Due to space constraints, it is difficult to put forth the whole analysis
process for all sectors. Therefore, we have mentioned sector-wise uncertainty percentage. The
uncertainty calculated for the transport sector is ± 30%. This estimated value greatly depends
upon the use of different sector-specific emission factors and activity data including different
road networks along with the total number of vehicles. Due to the source authenticity, the gross
uncertainty of emission factors and activity data did not have much disparity. Crucial factors like
precipitation days, moisture content of the soil, silt load, speed, and weight of vehicles have been
considered for emission calculation from the Wind-blown road dust sector. Number of precipitation
days in 2018 was taken from the Rainfall statistics of IMD (2020), which is not likely to have errors
but climatic factors can influence the silt load and moisture content of the soil. Therefore, this
sector has an uncertainty of ± 30%. The residential sector involving cooking activities, and diesel
generator emissions have fuel-induced (LPG, wood, kerosene, Diesel) EFs, and activity data of per
capita fuel consumption accounted to have ± 32% uncertainty. The industrial sector also uses
fuel and technology-specific emission factors. However, activity data used for this sector remains
disparity because of the unavailability of accurate data like usage of types and amount of fuel,
controlling equipment, technologies, etc. The spatial locations of individual industries were also
collected from private sites. Therefore, the sector holds an uncertainty of ± 62%. The other sector
comprising various minor sources and their corresponding fuel activities was found to have an
uncertainty of ± 28%. The overall uncertainty range of this entire inventory lies within ± 37%,
which is in the justifiable range.
4 CONCLUSIONS
A wide number of sources of air pollutants in Bhubaneswar have been identified. For gaseous
pollutants, the transport sector remains the dominant contributing sector while wind-blown road
dust plays a major role in the case of particulate pollutants. The usage of a maximum number of

personalized and aging vehicles is the main reason for road transport emissions. Diversion of
roads to decongestion of traffic flow along with regular cleaning of the dusty shoulders and
maintenance of busy roads can be another step to combat air pollution. Besides these, sectors
like residential cooking activities and industrial emissions have been emerging as prominent sources
of air pollution in the city. Access and availability of cost-effective cleaner solid/LPG gas fuels and
their consumption for commercial and residential cooking activities may reduce the pollutant load.
Our results focus on the key issues of cleaner air in Bhubaneswar that has to be assessed as per the
source-wise strategy and efficient control measures under the NCAP initiative of Govt. of India.

dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were
observed in many countries during the lockdowns. However, the levels of ozone (O3), a secondary air pollutant
linked to asthma and respiratory ailments, and secondary PM were frequently reported to remain unchanged or
even increase. An increase in O3 can enhance the formation of secondary PM2.5, especially secondary organic
aerosols, through the atmospheric oxidation of VOCs. Given that the gaseous precursors of O3 (VOCs and NOx)
are also involved in the formation of secondary PM2.5, an integrated control strategy should focus on reducing the
emission of the common precursors for the co-mitigation of PM2.5 and O3 with an emphasis on their complex
photochemical interactions. Compared to outdoor air quality, comprehensive investigations of indoor air quality
(IAQ) are relatively sparse. People spend more than 80% of their time indoors with exposure to air pollutants of
both outdoor and indoor origins. Consequently, an integrated assessment of exposure to air pollutants in both
outdoor and indoor microenvironments is needed for effective urban air quality management and for mitigation
of health risk. To provide further insights into air quality, we do a critical review of scientific articles, published
from January 2020 to December 2020 across the globe. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our review in
the context of global air quality improvement.

2020). Two cities in the north, Bergamo and Milan, were severely
affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 (Setti et al., 2020). Contini and
Costabile (2020) and Conticini et al. (2020) suggested that elevated air
pollution levels in northern Italy contributed to the pronounced number
of COVID-19 infections and high mortality. However, their conclusions
were driven based upon existing findings in the air quality and human
health domain. Further experimental and epidemiological studies are
urgently needed to evaluate the role of the air pollution in COVID-19
pandemic.
O3, NO2 and transition metals in PM2.5 and UFPs are potent oxidants
that are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can
induce adverse human health effects via inflammation and oxidative
stress (Lodovici and Bigagli, 2011; Øvrevik et al., 2015; See et al.,
2007b). However, compared to traffic-related emissions of primary
aerosols, the role of secondary aerosols in contributing to negative
health impacts is much less understood (Adams et al., 2015a).
Limited studies have been conducted to quantify health benefits
associated with strict lockdown measures imposed in polluted cities such
as reduced road traffic, telecommuting and mandatory wearing of face
masks. Han and Hong (2020) used publicly available data (PM2.5 con-
centrations and the local population) in Seoul (South Korea) from
2016–2020 (January to April) to estimate mortality rates in 2019 and
2020. While no strict lockdown was imposed in South Korea during the
study period, the PM2.5 levels decreased by 4.1 μg/m3 in 2020 in Seoul
compared to the previous 4 years. The lower PM2.5 concentration in
2020 was attributed to two factors: (i) reduced domestic emissions of
PM2.5 due to social distancing and increased telecommuting in Seoul and Fig. 3. Schematic of indoor air pollution and different ventilation and miti-
(ii) lower long-range transport of PM2.5 from China due to the gation scenarios.

ABSTRACT
A study for assessment of air quality was carried out in and around the Industrial belt of Jharsuguda and
Sambalpur district of Odisha, India. The 24 hrs average concentrations of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM),
Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM), were determined at regular intervals throughout three seasons for three
years at ten monitoring stations in residential areas and industrial areas. The 24 hrs average SPM and RPM
concentrations were 340.64µg/m3 and 131µg/m3 in industrial corridor. During the study period, 24 hrs and
5
annual average RPM and SPM concentrations exceeded the respective standards set in the Indian National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) protocol as well as USEPA, EU,WHO and World Bank standards at
most of the residential and industrial areas. The SPM, RPM have exceeded the permissible standard throughout
the year. Several field trips around the study area have been conducted and standard method have been
applied to measure the air quality parameters for consecutively three years (2017, 2018 and 2019) to evaluate
the present status of air pollution. The Air pollution has affected the inhabitants and pulmonary diseases are in
rising. This locality immediately needs remedial measures to control the pollution rate and to provide a quality
life to the inhabitants.

I. INTRODUCTION
The environmental pollution in an industrial cluster is a matter of great concern and also a critical issue for the
public. Pollution in a cluster being a complex multi-dimensional problem is often difficult to measure and
manage and it is very difficult to predict its effect on the environment and man. To address such a complex
problem, we have made an attempt to study a cluster of Odisha. It is located in the district of Sambalpur and
Jharsguda (Fig.1), which is considered a critically polluted area. Huge deposits of coal in the area and a vast
water reservoir (Hirakud), mineral availability along with good connectivity of road and rail makes the area a
most ideal site for the production of thermal power, sponge iron, iron and steel , aluminium smelter and cement.
Small scale industries like rice mills, bricks kilns and stone crushers are also operating in this area. The major
problem in the region is air pollution from different power plants and other metallurgical industries. The major
air pollutants are suspended particulate matters, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The
particulate matter going to the atmosphere is generally of size 0.1 to 100 micron of particle size. The inhabitants
are exposed to the dust continuously and get infected with infectious and contagious pulmonary disease such as
Tuberculosis. Field surveys adopting questionnaire method have been carried out around the study area to detect
the effect of dust and threat of pulmonary disease mostly Tuberculosis. (Attfield and Hodous, 1992; Levinson and
Jawetz, 2003). Dust causes disastrous effects and various health hazards. 2 to 20 micron size of dust particles affects
the lungs and dust particles having 2-3 micron size are more dangerous. Epithelial tissue of lungs is affected by the dust
of about 1micronsize (Attfield and Hodous, 1992; Attfield and Seixas, 1995; Henneberger and Attfield, 1996).The less
the size of the dust greater is the deposit in the lungs. The dust finally causes lesions in the lungs.
II. METHODOLOGY
Standard method and analysis was performed for collection of sample and laboratory studies [IS: 5182(part-
4):1999, IS5182 (Part-6):1975, IS: 5182(Part-2):1969.]
Present Study
The air samples were collected in every month in each season i.e during winter (December to February), pre-
monsoon (March to May), post monsoon (October and November) and brought to the laboratory and ambient air
quality monitoring were analyzed. The mean of various parameters were compared with National Ambient Air

III. MODELING AND ANALYSIS
The study area has been considered to be an area covered within a radius of 30kms Jharsguda town covering
Sambalpur. The survey has been conducted during period of three years from January 2017 to December 2019.
The Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) also known as PM , Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM) also known
10
as PM are collected on a fortnightly basis, during the first and the third week of each month, throughout the
2.5
year except rainy season by running the Respirable Dust Samplers (Model: Envirotech, APM 451 and 460 with
gaseous sampling attachment) for 8 hours in the day time (10.00AM to 6.00PM). The measured values have
been compared with 24 hourly standard stipulated as per National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS),
prescribed by CPCB, India for Residential, Rural and other. Sampling was done as per the standard sampling
procedure of Bureau of Indian Standard [IS: 5182(part-4):1999, IS5182 (Part-6):1975, IS: 5182(Part-2):1969].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SPM and RPM concentration: The estimated dust concentrations in various sampling locations are presented in the
Table-1. The estimated SPM and RPM concentrations in and around the industrial sites are more than the residential
areas.
Detection of Pulmonary Disease: To find out the effect of dust on the health of people living in and around the
study area, a sample of public (330inhabitantsin2017,312 in 2018 and327in2019)were interviewed using a
questionnaire. Questions in the questionnaire were drafted to detect the public’s awareness to pulmonary diseases
mostly the Tuberculosis. This preliminary survey adopting questionnaire method made us possible to detect early
symptoms of pulmonary diseases among the local inhabitants. Due to the air pollution the local inhabitants are also
being affected by respiratory disorders like black lung, bronchitis, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis and many other
diseases such as eye irritation, hypertension, lung cancer, etc. The numbers of suspected persons detected are181,
223 and 245 during 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.
The three years average data of SPM and RPM have shown in the Table-2 and Table-3 respectively. Year wise
concentration of SPM for ten sampling stations has been shown in Fig-2. Concentration of SPM of each sampling
station S1 to S10 have been shown in the Fig-3 to Fig-12

V. CONCLUSION
In the present study, estimation of the air pollution in the investigated area has been carried out and it was found that
the two important parameters SPM and RPM had higher values than its standard limit. Therefore it is obvious that
the number of suspected Tuberculosis infected patients are detected high for consecutive three years in a row (2017,
2018 and 2019). The study shows that both air pollution with SPM as well as RPM and number of Tuberculosis
patients have increased significantly in the successive years of investigation. It is also evident from the records of
the CDMO office of Jharsuguda that the district has recorded Tuberculosis as a serious health hazard in the
district. In last 5 Years 83926 cases of Tuberculosis has been registered and 60 cases of death due to
Tuberculosis also has been registered. (District Disaster Management Plan Jharsuguda, ODISHA 2018 Volume-
I). The results depict a direct relationship between air pollution and pulmonary diseases. It has been observed
that in all the sampling stations the values of SPM and RPM are exceeding the standard limit which is of great
concern for survival of local inhabitants with a healthy life.

ABSTRACT:
air pollution, harmful
Introduction: Odisha, a state with a thriving industrial sector, faces a serious problem with
pollutants, industrial
industrial air pollution. There have been considerable emissions of dangerous pollutants like
practices,
particulate matter (PM), Sulphur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and more due to explosive

rapid
illness, human death, environmental harm to other living things like food crops, as well as harm to

belt of Odisha and their impact on public health and to create an awareness among the people about
the expenses of these pollutants on the living beings and to mitigate the measures.
Methods: Data of the pollutants selected in the proposed areas are collected through Odisha State
Pollution Control Board (OSPCB), Bhubaneswar and we analysed the result by graphical analysis.
Results: Among all these locations, Brajraj Nagar has the highest average PM concentration
2.5
(47.79 µg/m3) and Beleipada has the highest PM concentration (138.60 µg/m3) whereas NO and
10 2
SO are under control.

Conclusions: To achieve this delicate balance and ensure a cleaner and healthier future for Odisha,
there must be cooperation highly essential among government, corporate businesses, academic
institutions, industries and civil society.

ABSTRACT
Plants are universal sink of carbon dioxide. Plantation of species along any road helps to trap air polluting dust
and carbon dioxide. The plants are also negatively affected by the dust and gaseous emissions from vehicles.
Because of industrialization in the Sambalpur region, the number of vehicles passing through National Highway-
6 has grown significantly. This has been the root cause of high level air pollution. In response to this, a study
was undertaken to evaluate the air pollutant tolerance level of some tree species present along the NH-6
between Ainthapali to Remed of Sambalpur township using Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) approach. The
aspects covered in this work are i) Identification and selection of plant species, ii) Analysis of biochemical
parameters like total chlorophyll content, leaf extract pH, relative water content, ascorbic acid of selected
species and estimation of air pollution tolerance index values for these species, iii) Evaluation of the Dust
accumulating capacity of the selected tree species and its relationship with other morphological parameters, iv)
Evaluation of relationship between plants morphological parameters, Dust accumulating capacity and APTI.
Three different species viz. Tectona grandis L.f., Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thw. and Ficus religiosa L. were
studied at three sites such as Ainthapali (Site-1), Bareipalli (Site-2) and Remed (Site-3). Relative water content
(RWC), Hydrogen ion Concentration of leaf extracts (pH), Total Chlorophyll content of leaf (TCH) , Ascorbic acid
content of leaf (AA) were estimated. The petiole length, Leaf area and inter-node lengths were also measured.
The dust accumulation potentials of three species were determined. Correlation and regression analysis
between different parameters were carried out. The species Tectona Grandis is highly tolerant to air pollution
with average APTI values ranging from 7.13 to 10.33. The established decreasing order for grades is Tectona
grandis (6) > Polyalthia longifolia (5) > Ficus religiosa (3). The Dust accumulation potential values are highly
correlatable with APTI.

based on an improved model which can extract the trough line from meteorological element data at 500 hPa. The
model adopts the UNet of a U-shaped encoder and decoder as basic structure, which is designed to enable precise

the trough, the Xception, which takes depthwise separable convolution as basic unit, is adopted to replace the
encoder of the original UNet. In addition, the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) module with an attention mechanism
is added after each ordinary convolution in the decoder part to improve the recognition accuracy by increasing
the weighting of the trough area. The experiments are conducted on a meteorological dataset and the results
show that the recognition accuracy with our proposed method on the testing dataset can reach over 80%. We also
compare our results to several other types of networks and traditional automatic identification methods, which
demonstrates that the performance of the proposed network is superior to other methods.

Fig. 1. The framework of the proposed network contains two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is used to extract trough features from the
meteorological data, in which the input samples are downsampled 4 times. The decoder is used to transform the parsed information into the final feature maps whose
shape is the same as the initial features through 4 upsampling stages. Each blue box in the figure corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The output feature
shape is at bottom of each layer, in which the first two represent the height and width of the feature maps, and the last represents the number of feature maps. The

ABSTRACT
Rapid industrialisation and Automobile exhaust has led to different facets of pollution. Vegetation can absorb
particulate and other gaseous pollutants into their system, but they also have some limitation and tend to show
symptoms of damage after prolonged exposure. Based on the absorbing power and tolerance limit, vegetation can be
classified as highly tolerant, moderately tolerant, sensitive and very sensitive. This has been incorporated by scientist
into a quantitative value of Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI), depending on the score of the plant physiology
indicators viz., Leaf Extract pH, Relative Water Content (RWC), Ascorbic Acid and Chlorophyll Content. The
vegetation monitoring in terms of its APTI acts as a ‘Bio-Indicator’ of air pollution and can be incorporated into
assessment studies. APTI was calculated for various plant species growing inside the F.M. University campus in
Balasore district. The leaf samples were collected from 16 number of tree species in F.M. University campus of
Balasore to determine APTI. In the present study, APTI value indicates that majority of plants are sensitive to air
pollution and only four plants like Mangifera indica, Ficus religiosa, Anacardium occidentalis and Zizipus spp. are
intermediately tolerant. Thus these tree species could act as the bio indicators for pollutants and could be utilized as
tolerant species towards combating air pollution.
Keywords: APTI, Bio-Indicator, Intermediately Tolerant, Sensitive, F.M. University.

INTRODUCTION
AIR being an important and vital component of earth’s environment and slightly change in its composition can have
varied effects on the growth, development and survival of different organisms on this planet. Similarly plants also
play an important role in monitoring the ecological balance by actively participating in the cycling of nutrients and
gases like carbon dioxide, {reg} oxygen and also provide enormous leaf area for impingement, absorption and
accumulation of air pollutants to reduce the pollution level in the air environment. Today’s growing pollution and
rapid industrialisation has resulted in deterioration of ambient air quality. There are five primary or major air

pollutants these are 1.Oxides of carbon (CO, CO ), 2. Sulphur dioxide (SO ), 3.Oxides of nitrogen (NO ), 4.
2 2 X
Hydrocarbons, 5. Particulate matters, which react with one another and with other substances and go to produce
secondary pollutants which are extremely harmful to living organisms. Air pollution is causing a number of changes
in vegetation. Reduction in plant height, canopy area, plant biomass and chlorophyll, ascorbic acid and nitrogen
content in plants growing at sites receiving higher pollution are some of the common responses [1]. Leaves responds
to pollution and undergo quantitative changes in varying degree in a number of leafs surface micro morphological
character [2]. The leaves are generally used as experimental material as they take up large amount of pollution [3].
APTI is species dependent plants attribute which express the inherent ability of the plant to encounter stress
emanating from pollution. There is a scale of APTI value which indicates that APTI value between 30-100 the
species is tolerant; APTI value 17-29 as intermittently tolerant; and plants registering APTI value in the range of 1-16
are considered as sensitive; APTI value lower than 1 is branded as highly sensitive [4]. Sensitivity and response of
plants to air pollutants is variable. The plant species which are more sensitive act as biological indicators of air
pollution. The response of plants to air pollution as physiological and biochemical levels can be understood by
analysing the factors that determine resistance and susceptibility. Using plants as indicator of air pollution is the
possibility of synergistic action of pollutants. The ambient environment of an urban area may be contaminated with
several pollutants such as SO , CO, NO and Heavy metals and the plants growing there would be exposed not only
2 X
to one but too many pollutants and their different conditions. Methods used to determine the APTI by synthesizing
the values of four different biochemical parameters i.e. Leaf Extract pH, Ascorbic Acid, Total Chlorophyll and
Relative Water Content (RWC). Species having higher APTI value are more tolerant to air pollution than those
having lower APTI value. Species having lower APTI value may act as bio indicator of pollution. Impact of plant
community gas also been studied worldwide in terms of plant environment interactions, since the plants are much
more sensitive in comparison to other organism. The symptoms or effect including changes in the plant anatomy,
physiology and biochemistry indicate a polluted environment. The pollutants enter into the plants and react in variety
of ways before being removed or absorbed that may include accumulation, chemical transformation and incorporation
into the metabolic system. In the present study tolerant species to air pollution have been identified in respect to the
above four biochemical parameters which may help in proper selection of species in F.M. University campus in
Balasore district and important finding are reported in this communication.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Area : Orissa extends from 17011’ to 22015’ N latitude and from 81’29 E longitude on the eastern coast of
India. Balasore is lies in the east direction of the state which extends from latitude 21’32’30”N to 85’40’ 37” E
longitude. The study area of around F.M University and Nuapadhi village which is well concerted to Balasore town
and NH-5 and is 15KM away from NH-5 and 20KM away from SE railway. There are two industries such as Emami
paper mill and Balasore Alloys ltd. These two industries are situated 2-4 km away from FM University and Nuapadhi
village. There are also four crusher units are present outside to the F.M. University campus. River Sono which is a
tributary of river Budhabalanga flowing in the heart of the study area. The study area experiences moderate type of
the monsoon climate, rain fall is observed between June to September, normal rain fall was reported to be 1600 mm.
The mean daily relative humidity (RF) is 55% during June to September and 28% in October to march, 20% during
April to May. The average wind speed in the study area varies from 0.5 to 10 KM per hour wind direction of east
southwest to north northwest. The highest temperature in the summer season is 45oC and lowest temperature is 15oC
in the month of January. Nilagiri subdivision is mostly hill terrain and vegetated with tropical semi ever green forest.
The hills of Nilagiri has highest peak of 1783’ above the sea level. It is a region of valuable forest resource. The soil
type of Nuapadhi is alluvial literate.
A total of 16 different tree species were selected for the study in the different places inside the F.M. University
campus. The screening and selection of the plant species are partly based on literature survey of similar work and
guideline of Central Pollution Control Board [5]. Composite leaf samples were sampled in polyethylene bags, tagged
and brought to the laboratory and analysed for several biochemical parameter. The Air Pollution Tolerance Index
(APTI) was developed by analysing the biochemical parameters of leaf material, viz., pH, Ascorbic Acid, Relative
Water Content and Total Chlorophyll [6]. The pH values were estimated by using a digital calibrated pH meter. Total
Chlorophyll and Ascorbic Acid of leaf extract was estimated by spectrophotometer method. Relative Water Content
of leaf was estimated by gravimetric method by determining the leaf weight under different condition like initial
weight, turgid weight and Dry weight. The formula used to determine the Air Pollution Tolerance Index “APTI”
using the four parameters [7].

APTI= {A (T+P) + R}/10
Where A= Ascorbic Acid (mg/g)
T= Total Chlorophyll Content of Leaf (mg/g/fw)
P= pH of the leaf extract and
R= Relative Water Content of leaf extract (%)
The entire sum was divided by 10 to obtain a small manageable figure.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Air Pollution Tolerant Index (APTI) is calculated for 16 plant species growing inside the F.M. University campus and
the data is presented in table-1. All biochemical parameters that are used for analysed APTI plays significant role to
determine resistivity and susceptibility of plant species. Chlorophyll content of plants signifies its photosynthetic
activities as well as the growth and development of biomass. It is well evident that chlorophyll content of plants
varies from species to species; age of leaf and also with the pollution levels as well as with other biotic and abiotic
conditions [8]. Higher the sensitive natures of the plant species lower the chlorophyll content. Ascorbic Acid is
important in cell wall synthesis, photosynthetic carbon fixation and cell division [9], pH as an indicator for sensitivity
to air pollution [10], total chlorophyll is also related to ascorbic acid productivity. Pollution load dependent increase
in ascorbic acid content of all the plant species may be due to the increased rate of production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) during phyto-oxidation of SO to SO where sulphites are generated from SO absorbed. The higher
2 3 2
ascorbic acid content of the plant is a sign of its tolerance against sulphur dioxide pollution [11, 12]. Air pollution in
urban area and industrial areas may get adsorbed, absorbed, accumulated or integrated in the plant body and if toxic,
may injure them in various ways. The levels of injury will be high in sensitive species and low in tolerant ones. The
tolerant species of plants function as pollution “sink” and therefore a number of environmental benefits can be
desired by planting tolerant species in polluted areas. To evaluate the tolerance level of plant species to air pollution
used four leaf parameters to drive an empirical number indicating the Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) [13].
Based on APTI values the plants were conveniently grouped as follows [14].
APTI values Response
30-100 Tolerant
29-17 Intermediate
1-16 Sensitive
<1 Very sensitive
In the present study out of 16 species four species such as Mangifera indica (17.81), Ficus religiosa (22.49),
Anacardium occidentalis (17.39) and Zizipus spp. (24.76) showed their intermediated response by changing their
biochemical characters. The remaining twelve species showed APTI values of less than 16 which were designed as
sensitive range. The analysis of biochemical parameters showed a marked variation between tolerant and sensitive
species. The ascorbic acid content ranges between 7.16 to 19.75mg in intermediately tolerant species and 1.76 to
8.51mg among the sensitive plant species. The total chlorophyll content ranges between 2.6 to 10.12mg in
intermediately tolerant plant and 1.89 to 11.51mg in sensitive plants. The RWC ranged between 85.24% to 87.61% in
intermediately tolerant species and 80.14% to 88.71% in sensitive plant species. The pH ranges between 4.4 to 8.2 in
both intermediately tolerant and sensitive plant species. In the present study out of the 16 species of plants only four
species can serve as indicator of industrial air pollution namely mangifera indica, Ficus religiosa, Anacardium
occidentalis and Zizipus spp.
APPLICATIONS
Appropriate species can be selected for the green belt development in industrial area.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on the present study it is concluded that the APTI values can be used as predictor of air quality. In the present
studies out of 16 species only 4 species indicates that intermediately tolerant and another twelve species are sensitive
to air pollution may be due to the industrial pollution or toxic gases from nearby industries and only four plant
species which can be used for Green Belt Development. In eco-friendly conservation and pollution abatement
through green belt development plan for a particular sector mainly depends upon, nature and extent of pollution load,

sinking capacity of the ecosystem, climatic factors and soil and water quality. In this study the species like mangifera
indica, Ficus religiosa, Anacardium occidentalis and Zizipus spp. can be potentially used for bio-monitoring of air
quality in polluted areas (Table1).

I. Introduction
Due to the rapid industrialization in Jharsuguda and Rengali areas in the western part of Orissa, severe
changes in environmental conditions have been notified. This has affected not only the human activities but also
the plants and animal kingdom of the region. In order to access the impacts of industrialization on flora, fauna
and aquatic system of the region, impact monitoring has been carried out in the years 2013 to 2014. The
collected data prevails that there is a gradual increase of SPM SO and NO in the region. There are 26 sponge

iron plants with power plants are working on the L&T main road from Rengali to Jharsuguda. Two aluminium
sectors with large scale production are also going to be ready soon. One aluminium sector Vedanta has a captive
power plant of 2400MW power. The underground and open cast coal mines are also disturbing the noise and air
environment. There are many new power projects also coming shortly in Ib Valley area. The pollutions are due
to urbanization, rapid industrialization, mineralization and other associate activities.
Now Rengali and Jharsuguda area are considered as the most polluted areas of Odisha. The major air
pollutants are suspended particulate matters, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The
particulate matter going to the atmosphere are generally of size 0.1 to 100 micron of particle size, which remains
suspended for long time depending on its weights. But particulate matters going to the atmosphere greater than
100 micron settle on the nearby surface, soil, water, bodies, etc due to the gravity. Due to the air pollution
human being are also effected mainly by respiratory disorders like black lung, bronchitis, asthma, pulmonary
fibrosis, eye irritation, hypertension, lung cancer, etc.
To access the air pollution, noise pollution and its impact to public health, a detailed study is carried
out systematically by the present piece of paper. This study helps to get some idea to the present threats to the
environment resulting into climate change.
II. Experimental Method
In order to access the air pollution level due to rapid industrialization, mining activity, transportation
& urbanization and deforestation of Jharsuguda and Sambalpur districts from Rengali to IB Thermal area, which
is the most polluted area of Orissa during the last five years. Twenty sample survey stations in different
directions were selected which are given in tables 2, 3 and 4. The month of May, September and December were
chosen and taken into account the season i.e. summer, post monsoon and winter of the year 2013-14. In these
months once in a week the samples were collected twice a day in an interval of 12 hours. To evaluate the
pollution level in Rengali area, six sampling stations in different directions representing commercial, industrial
and residential activities were selected. The locations are Ganesh Nagar, BSNL Office, Ram Chandar Nagar,
Colony of Shyam DRI, Lapanga village and Thelkoloi Market area. In Jharsuguda eight sampling stations such
as Vedanta Rehabilitation Colony, Sarbahal Residential area, Engineering School area, Proposed Air Port
Durlaga, Roof of Proposed Navodaya School near Eastern Steel, Buxi Chowk Jharsuguda, Budhipadar Village
Club and Badamal were chosen. Similarly in Belpahar area Bandhabahal Market Roof, IB Thermal Market
Roof, Lakhanpur vilage Area and Lamtibahal petrol pump area were selected for sample collection.
For the study of air quality such as SPM, SO , NO were done by a high volume air sampler

manufactured by Envirotech HVAS operated at an average flow rate of 1.0m2/min to 1.5m2/min. Pre-weighted
glass micro fiber filter size (GF/A of Whatman) were used and concentration was computed as per standard

method prescribed by BIS. Sulphur dioxide in air of the areas under study was absorbed in 35ml of sodium
tetrachloromercurate and for oxides of nitrogen in air of the sampling area was absorbed in 35ml of sodium
nitrite solution at a average flow rate of 0.2 to 0.5 liter per minute by standard method which is internationally
accepted. Similarly dust fall rate was calculated for the formula:
30 / 2
Dust fall rate =
𝑊𝑋 𝑔𝑚 𝑚
where ‘W’ is total dust 𝑎fa𝑋ll𝑛 in gm; ‘a’ is cross sectional area in m2 of the funnel; and ‘n’ is number of
days over which sampling was done. The sample were collected periodically an analysed in Regional Pollution
Control Board, Angul and Sambalpur, Environment Consultant BF Odisha, Department of Chemistry, VSSUT,
Burla.

IV. Plantation Techniques
Trees are woody plants grown for various purposes like specimen tree, shady tree, avenue, screening
fragrant and checking air and noise pollution. The selected trees should be best branching habits, arrangement
of leaves, size, shape, surface(smooth / hairy / waxy), high proline content, ascorbic acid content, cationic
peroxidase and suphite oxidase activity to trap the pollutants.
Close plantation of 3 to 4 rows of Alstonia scholaris intermixed with Ficus cunea should be planted
towards the dust source as these are evergreen in nature and will act as dust collector and protect the green belt
from grazing. As Alstonea and Ficus cunea are slow growing plants, some fast growing evergreen plats having
good dust removing capacity should be planted. Evergreen M-indica and Derris indica are most suitable for this
purpose. Next Typically hardy, fast growing plats like Leucanea, Acacia, Auriculiformis, Eucalyptus, Casia
fistula, C-siamea, Laga duclcis should be planted. It is recommended that 8m wide green belts between road and
buildings can reduce dust by 2-3 times. Trees like Sal, etc, deflect or refract sound waves.
Engineering methods and plantation techniques are adopted according to the speed of vehicles,
machines used in industries and mine blasting, green belts of 18m to 30m width, 15-27m for traffic lane with
central row of at least 13m-15m tall are necessary for high speed vehicles, while for moderate speed, green belt
of 6m-15m width within the edge of the belt 6m-15m from the centre of nearest traffic lane; shrubs of 1.8m to
4m high should be planted to traffic lane.

The noise level was studied in 1998-1999 in 12 locations of Ib valley area and the average value in
opencast area was 72 – 92 dB I day time and 58 – 69 in night time. The value in Jharsuguda area is 60-80 dB
and Belpahar it is 50-70 dB respectively(D.K.Sahu in Ph.D. thesis) the noise level has been increased now 2012-
13 it is 80-98dB in mine areas, 70-88 dB in Jharsuguda and 60-80 in Belpahar area. This is due to rapid
industrialization from Rengali to Belpahar, heavy transportation, more urbanization etc. which can impact
damage of hearing, mental tension, fatigue, arrogance, blood pressure, neurological problem, abnormal behavior
of child birth, etc. This can be controlled by both engineering technology and plantation method (sal
tree)(D.K.Sahu, P.Srinivas, K.C.Satpathy-1997) Maiti S.K. 1992 data collected of plant S.K.Maiti, Nepak S.P.
Sahu D.K., Sinha B.K. 2000, noise pollution and its control by trees.

*DRI: Direct reduced iron
It is experimentally estimated that to get 1 ton of sponge iron, approximately 1.3 ton of coal of semi
bituminous type having fly ash about 40%, 1.5.tons of iron ore having Fe O 65% and 8Kg of dolomite is
2 3
required in a DRI kiln. To get 1 ton of iron approximately 2.88 ton of total raw material is required which
release 30% of the pollutants to the atmosphere as dust. The Shyam Metalik plant and Biraj steel is attached to
the Hirakud reservoir near Lapanga reservoir area. A black layer of suspended particles is seen on the water
which is a problem for aquatic animals.

Environmental Problem
The fugitive emission of SPM during drilling, blasting, movement of heavy earth moving machinery on
haul road, collection , transportation, handling of coal, screening, segregation. CH gas is released in
4
underground mines which tends to raise the temperature.
V. Result And Discussion
It is observed that in the average sample of post monsoon seasons, the atmosphere is relatively clean
due to the precipitation effect of rain. The values of SPM, SO and NO are less as compare to winter and
2 2
summer. The collected data revel sampling is done in the month of summer on the study area and its
surrounding having more concentration of SPM, SO and NO are on higher side. This is due to the continuous
2 2
operation of the plants close to the Sambalpur - Jharsuguda highway. Due to the release of coal dust, fly ash, etc,
from the 11 mini steel plants and power including Bhushan steel plant, the area is polluted day by day. The
companies are necessary to take required action, measure to stop pollution of the environment. But not much
care is taken to control the pollution by the industries as per the view of the local people, social workers, even
the pollution control board of Sambalpur, Jharsuguda. Travels and other heavy vehicles are engaged in
transportation of coal, iron ore and other materials. They are generating a lot of dusts, sulphur dioxide and oxide
of nitrogen. Jharsuguda and Rengali belt is on the 8 critical cluster zone due to improper environment planning
of concern industry and government. Presently government has signed more that 45 companies out of its 39
companies started partial production till now. If all the 45 company start daily production 86642.92 metric ton
and 31624662y/mt tons of fly ash may be generated. These is no such planning to proper disposal and use of fly
ash. The water holding of river Mahanadi, Ib, Bheden rivers is going to be decreased. The best solution is to
start many cement plants, bricks, mine filling and heavy plantation. Recently government declared to build all
government offices with fly ash bricks.
 As per CPCB, two sponge iron factories should be operated at least one km apart from each other.
 Due to ash and pollution control load in pond, temperature increases up to 47oC, rice production and
fertility of soil decreased as there is no nitrogen fixation.
 Due to Bhushan, 46.18 acres of land was deforested. 20862 big trees and 5423 small tress were cut.
 Due to Shyam DRI, 94.87 acre land was deforested, 905 big trees were cut.
So a massive afforestation program is required. Presently Government declared all the industries of Jharsuguda
to plant 300 000 trees in 2014-15.

VI. Remedial Measures
1. Electrostatic precipitator (ESP), cyclone separate, dust collector, continuous humidifier should be used to
control the dust generated. Installation of such equipment and their running must be made compulsory.
2. Deforestation should be stopped by the industries and social forestry should be given more priority by the
industries.
3. Plantation should be done in vacant place like road sides, railway lines, school areas, hospitals and vacant
village areas.
4. Alostonia scholarsis with Ficus conia should be planted in road sides towards the dust source.
5. Fast growing plants like M-indicia, Derris indicia (suitable for dust collection) should be planted at ash
dumping and heavy loading unloading dusts area.
6. Water sprinkler should be installed at regular intervals with in the industrial complex.
7. The main stack of the industries should be minimum 250 meter height as per the rule of central pollution
control board.
8. Regular monitoring of the area to measure the pollution load (sampling station establishment) and regular
health camp with a mobile van to check the health of local people is required.
VII. Conclusion
Due to uncontrolled operation of mining industries as well as metallic industries in the Jharsuguda and
Sambalpur districts, huge amount of air pollutants are released to the atmosphere every day. The SPM, SO and
2
NO are exceeding the permissible limit of CPCB guidelines. The pollutants are not only affecting the living
X
beings, but also affecting the structures, buildings and other materials due to precipitation of pollutants in the
form of acid rain. Hence the regulatory agencies should initiate steps right now to reduce the release the
pollutants to the atmosphere.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Daitari Iron Ore Mine in Odisha
Amiya Bhaumik* & Dr B.P.Sahu†
Abstract
The environmental impact assessment is very vital for any sites involved in extracting
resources. There are nearly 257 iron ore mines in India and the maximum amount of iron ore
extracted is from Chhattisgarh, followed by Goa and Jharkahand. The production of iron ore
during 2017 in India was to the extent of 190 million metric tons and it is expected to rise in the
coming years. It is well known that iron ore mines contribute substantially for the economy of
our country. But it creates adverse effects on the environment. For every ton of iron ore
extracted nearly about two and half tons of wastes are generated. These wastes when allowed to
flow in to the rivers or nallas affect the water quality and also the aquatic lives. Further the
ecology of the total area gets disturbed because of cutting of the forests, loss of vegetation and
the top layer of the soil. This affects the agriculture adversely. Though every effort is made to
maintain the ambient air quality in the work zone and also in the vicinity of the mining areas, but
it is not possible in large scale mining operations inspite of the best of efforts. The measures
taken to control the flow of mine wastes are not sufficient. In the absence of proper pollution
control measures, the run-offs from the mines create pollution in the nearby streams as observed
through its colour and turbidity. This water thus becomes unfit for human and animal
consumption. Through tailing dams efforts are being made to settle the iron ore slimes and clear
water discharges to down streams. But major effort is required for recycling of the solid wastes.
Reclamation of waste is a way out. There is further a need for massive afforestation programme
to create lush greenery areas which is a prerequisite sustainable mining operation.
Keywords: Environmental impact assessment, iron ore, solid wastes, water pollution, aquatic
lives.
Introduction:
The history of mineral development and production in India dates back to almost 6000
years. The remains of some of the old mine working are lying witness to this phenomenon. In

fact, some of these have led to the discovery of several large mineral deposits which are
operational today like Lead & Zinc in Zawar, Copper in Khetri, and Gold in Karnataka etc.
Despite the active past, the metal mining activities in the country remained dormant over a long
period until the beginning of the last century. Modern mining industry in India started its
journey long back in 1774, when East India Company permitted an English Company to
undertake coal mining in Raniganj area. Later in 1880 gold mining was started in Kolar
goldfield in Karnataka by M/S John Tylor and Sons.
At present India produces as many as 84 minerals comprising 4 fuels, 11 metallic, 49
non-metallic industrial and 20 minor minerals. The total number of mineral deposits are 13,000,
occupying about 0.7 million hectares which is 0.21 percent of the total land mass of the country.
Mining is carried out at more than 3100 locations in India for different minerals. The mining
leases numbering 9244 are spread over 21 states. India is largely self sufficient in most of the
minerals which includes barytes, bauxites, chromites, dolomite, fluorspar, gypsum, iron ore,
lignite, limestone, manganese ore, magnesite, and sillimanite, etc. except some minerals like
copper, asbestos, lead and zinc, natural phosphates, sulphur, and crude petroleum in which
domestic production meets the demand only partially (National Mineral Inventory, 2010).
India is Asia’s third and worlds eleventh largest economy. It has resources of 12745
million tons of Iron ore, 2525 million tons of bauxite, 76446 million tons of limestone; 233
million tons of magnesite, 167 million tons of lead & zinc ore, 70 million tons of barites, 176
million tons of manganese ore and 90 million tons of chromite. Of the total known global
resources of the minerals, the reserves of iron ore, bauxite and manganese accounts for nearly 7
percent, 16 percent and 6 percent respectively. India is also the largest producer of mica blocks
and mica splitting. It is also the third largest producer of coal & lignite and barites. In case of
chromite production it stepped up and reached the third rank. It is among top 5 producers of iron
ore in world and comes in top 6 producers of bauxite and manganese ore. India comes among
the top 7 producer of steel and top 10 producer of aluminum. Growth in India has received a lot
of attention in recent years with its GDP growing on average 7.5 percent and expected to
increase to 10 percent. To sustain such growth rates there is substantial requirement for
infrastructure development, which in turn increases the demand for coal, electricity, steel and
cement. To increase production of these key inputs, India needs to improve productivity and
efficiency of its coal, mining, minerals and energy sector. This growth and modernization of the
93
94
Indian mining sector has opened many opportunities for the minerals and mining industry (Singh
et al, 2010).
Mining industry in India has been progressing at an annual rate of 4% to 5% during the
last three decades. The overall value of minerals being extracted in India exceeds US $ 11.32
billion during 2011- 2012. Thus the contribution of mining to Gross Domestic Product has
increased from 0.56 percent (pre independence period, before 1947) to 2 to 3 percent. Today
India is one of the leading producers and exporters of several minerals in the world. Further
Indian mining industry provides employment to over 1.1 million people with 16 percent share in
India’s export.
Under this backdrop mining industry is emerging as major contributor to India’s
economic growth as well as employment opportunities. However, their exploration, excavation
and mineral processing directly infringe upon and affect the other natural resources like land,
air, water, flora and fauna, which are to be conserved and optimally utilized in a sustainable
manner. Mining is associated with different peripheral problems like dust, traffic, road,
communication and other related problems. With mining, different industries like sponge iron,
crushers and railway sidings set up in a radius of 5 Km to 500 Kms. As the roads of rural areas
are mostly of village/block roads of low carrying capacity, the transportation of iron ore from
mines to different locations creates dust laden atmosphere later on in the peripheral areas. Due to
surge in iron ore production and transportation, the clumsy roads are laden with heavy traffic
throughout the day and night which restricts the emergency services like supply of commodities
and attending health care. Bad road condition discourages the public carrier owners like buses to
ply in these conditions.
In iron ore mining & other allied activities including processing of ore, dust is the single
largest air pollutant and can be a significant nuisance to surrounding land users as well as a
potential health risk in some circumstances. Dust is being produced from a number of sources
and through number of mechanisms such as land clearing, removal of top soil, overburden
removal, drilling, blasting, crushing & screening, processing of ore, loading & unloading of
material on site & subsequent transport off the site etc. In addition to this, wind action affecting
stockpiles, dry tailings and exposed mining areas also generate significant amount of dust.
Noise, vibration and air blast are unavoidable fallouts of mining operations, which involve using
large mobile equipment, fixed plant and blasting. Noise, vibration and air blast are among the
94
95
most significant issues for communities located near mining projects. The adverse impact of
these needs to be contained.
To protect the environment, mining sector in general, is regulated by the Environment
(Protection) Act: 1986, the Forest Conservation Act: 1980, the Mines and Minerals
Development and Regulation) Act: 1957, Wild Life Act: 1972, Water (Prevention & Control of
Pollution) Act: 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act: 1981. In order to protect
the environment from iron ore mines, environmental standards specific for Indian Iron Ore
Mines are proposed under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The proposed standards are
primarily based on the studies conducted, normal background information, (collected through
actual site monitoring during the mines visit and collected from different mining authorities and
regulatory bodies), comparison and evaluation of national and international standards as well as
the presence of different harmful elements and their likely health effect. There is not much
precedence of existing iron ore mine specific environmental standards, internationally. Only
United States Environment Protection Agency has specified the discharge standards for iron ore
mining, whereas the same is covered by Canada through a blanket standard for all the
metalliferous mines. Also the World Bank has issued certain guidelines on pollution limits for
air, water and noise.
The Study Area:
Occupying an important position on the country's map, Odisha's rich mineral reserves
constitute 28% Iron ore, 24% coal, 59% Bauxite and 98% Chromite of India's total deposits. The
state's comparative advantage on this account has attracted the attention of many mining and
metallurgical companies. Iron ore is abundantly available in the districts of Mayurbhanj,
Sundargarh, Keonjhar and Jajpur. The state is also India’s main supplier of valuable minerals
such as chromites, nickel ore, coal, bauxite, iron ore and manganese. About 30% of its area is
under forest cover, which provides for the livelihood of a large and growing tribal population. It
is a co-incidence that, the forest area of the state is superimposed with its mineral deposit,
richest biodiversity regions, and water catchment of major rivers and habitat of tribal community
of state.
Daitari is situated in district of Keonjhar and Jajpur in the state of Odisha. With deposits
of 50 million tonnes of ore, the Daitari mines at Talipada village under Keonjhar and Jajpur
districts are OMC's flagship operations. The Daitari mines had recorded production of 703,440
tonnes of ore in the year 2013. It is under the control of the state. Units such as Vis Steel,
95
96
Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL), Aarti Steels and Bhushan steel, are heavily dependent on
iron ore supplies from the Daitari mines. The Daitari lease area falls under the Deogaon and
Sukinda ranges of Rebana reserve forest. The area is a hilly terrain with RL difference of about
400 mtrs between quarry & town ship. The area comes under Rebena Reserve forest & Daitari
protected forest.
The lease area is connected with Brahamnipal town at a distance of 12 km through a
State road. Paradeep Express Highway passes at a distance of about 2.5 km from the leasehold
area. Nearest rail head is at Daitari on Daitari - Jhakhapura section of East Coast Railway, which
is located near to the leasehold area. Besides there some ancillary facilities, including town ship,
crushing and screening plant, and water reservoir located in two nearby areas which are spread
over 236.34 ha and 48.98 ha. The mineable reserves of iron ore in the lease-hold have been
estimated to be 66.980 million tonnes (Mt). Cut-off grade of iron ore is considered to be 58%
Fe. The mine has been in continuous operation since 1966.
Problem and method:
The mining sector has been facing severe criticism on several issues relating to its
performance vis-à-vis sustainable development because of the following reasons. The minerals,
forests and tribal tracts are concentrated in the same geographic areas. As seen from the mineral
map of India, several areas with very high mining activity are in the poorest districts. The
historical and ongoing conflict between mining mineral reserves and conserving environmental
resources will continue to exist even in future as India’s forests, mineral bearing areas, major
river watersheds, tribal habitat regions and most backward regions overlap significantly.
A closer look shows that many of these share a common geography with the most
ecologically rich and culturally sensitive areas in Odisha. This brings home the reality that in
recent decades; mining activities have resulted in little local benefit, and in fact, has been at the
cost of environmental degradation. This situation has greatly contributed to general social
dissatisfaction and unrest in these mining belts; further exacerbated by undervaluation of lands
that were acquired by the government for development of mines. Long pending and pertinacious
resettlement (legacy) issues have contributed to a deep local mistrust of mining and all
associated activities including exploration studies. This is not helped by the fact that the issue of
land ownership is a highly complex one, layered with a variety of rights granted over its use-
some of which are customary and traditional, and may not be recognised under law; this is
perhaps most problematic in tribal areas. To illustrate, the recent provision for the settlement of
96
97
forest rights for forest dwelling communities creates a whole new challenge for the mining
companies and the administration to settle those rights, and a long demanded opportunity for the
communities to claim those rights. The coincidence of rich biodiversity with mineral bearing
areas is understood but not adequately factored into the comprehensive assessment and
mitigation of long term impacts, leading to inadequate response from the project proponents and
the regulators.
The recent boom in the demand for low grade iron ore has contributed to intensifying the
above issues in addition to giving an impetus to illegal mining. Legal and regulatory loopholes
and inadequate policing has allowed the illegal mining operations to flourish and grow.
Commentators point out that the boom is also responsible for unforeseen profits across the board
from small to large mining and associated operations, contributing a substantial increase,
especially over the last 7 years. Internationally dropping standards of acceptable grades of iron
ore have led to mines being re-opened, mine life being revised, even old over-burdens being
mined (as what was previously waste, is now a resource). Even as it is hard to ignore the
contribution that the resultant economic development has made it has been at a very high cost,
the impacts of which, environmentalists and social activists feel have not been fully understood
and appreciated. More intensive use beyond sustainable limits has been contributing significant
pressures on land, air, water, forests, biodiversity , especially due to the increased pace resulting
from market demands and made possible through newer, improved technologies.
Immediate and long term damages sustained as a result of this increase have already
severely compromised the lives of the local communities (even as some sections have benefitted
economically from it), and are set to manifest into longer term damages in terms of health,
livelihoods and overall living quality; and Community benefit-sharing as managed by mining
companies (e.g. Truck transport contracts for ore movement to local community) in several areas
has resulted in severe environmental degradation which has come to be into a vicious circle
that, on the one hand has become hard to break because it is profitable for the beneficiary
community, and on the other, goes unregulated as part of the business of mining, has added to
the list of conflicts associated with the sector. Enforcement is a key drawback with regulatory
arrangements in the sector and is the biggest point of criticism from all stakeholder groups
involved. It has been stated during several discussions on the subject that it is better
enforcement, rather than more regulation that can begin to remedy the ills plaguing the sector
today.
97
98
Regulators at all levels are also severely limited by the lack of adequate and usable
information/data, as also clarity and definition on several aspects pertaining to mining
operations. This lack compounds the issue of inadequate enforcement and also creates the
necessary gaps for illegal operations to carry on, unchecked. Several levels of illegality can
flourish, in terms of boundary violations, over-extraction, under-reporting production and
export, among others, though lesser degree violations are also rampant in other mining regions
of the country. The rate of extraction is currently seen to be a function of market demand alone
(and the capacity of the miner to extract) – not taking into account the stress on existing (and
limited) network infrastructure. Fluctuations in the market make planning for peak flows on
infrastructure networks difficult. Several mining areas in the country report more acute problems
faced by the resident community, in terms of vehicular pollution, traffic jams, and dust & road
conditions, than about the mining activity itself.
While there are some economic benefits that may be gained by the communities living
around mining areas in terms of employment and business, it is the vulnerable sections: women,
children and old people, who sustain several negative impacts, and have more limited coping
mechanisms. These impacts range from health, reduced access to resources, increased drudgery,
insecurity due to influx of outsiders and finally little benefits from mining. Mining companies
are the biggest defaulters on issues like provision of safe working environment, labour health
and safety and human rights issues especially in quarry sites. While mines provide the most
significant employment opportunities, they also demonstrate a poor record on and commitment
to these issues. Irregularities, illegality, under-reporting, widespread violations of labour and
safety norms, persistence of child labour, poor working conditions, and a general disregard for
environmental safeguards have all been reported in this segment.
The situation is made more difficult with multiple agencies responsible for regulation,
the lack of proper documentation and approvals, where significantly more stringent regulations
apply to the minor minerals segment, on paper. This wide gap has thrown up several suggestions
for the proposed resolution and management of the emerging issues. They feel that state level
specificities to do with minor minerals are better appreciated at the state level and will be better
managed with more regulations and control. Some states have demonstrated improved
administrative by using royalty-sharing arrangements to target fund provision for local area
improvement, infrastructure finance, while also demonstrating a closer, consequent relation
between mining and area improvement in the same geography. For example Gujarat provides for
98
99
90% of the royalties collected by the state (from the minor minerals segment) to flow back to the
source district, and 20% of that to be allocated to the source tehsil for development of the area.
Mining operations, both open-pit and underground, typically produce large volumes of
tailings deposits and waste rock piles. They may cause air pollution, water pollution and land
degradation problems. These wastes can affect the environment through its chemical and
mineralogical composition, its physical properties, its volume and the surface occupied, the
waste disposal method, climatic conditions liable to modify the disposal conditions, geographic
and geological location with existing targets liable to be affected (man and his environment).
Thus, identification of the environmental risks associated with the exploitation of mines and
quarries and with ore processing not only requires the characterization and quantification of the
different types of waste, as well as a knowledge of the processes used, but also an assessment of
the vulnerability of the specific environment contingent upon the geological and hydro
geological conditions and peripheral targets. Meteoric precipitation also transfers pollutant from
a tailings dam or a processing plant to the river if the waste management is not efficient.
The main objective of the study is to study the air, water, and noise level at different
location of the mines. The research question is - what is the present air, water, and soil quality
and noise level at different locations in comparison to safe limits? The universe of the study is
jurisdiction of OMC mines engaged in mining iron ores. The Daitari mine is selected as the
sample using purposive sampling procedure as part of the research process for selection of mine.
This was based on location, topography, accessibility by the investigator and time frame of
research.
Air, Water and Noise level at different location of the mines:
The present study presents the environmental related data in respect of, Ambient Air
Quality, Work Zone Air Quality (Fugitive Emission), Noise Level, Work zone Noise Level,
Surface Water Quality and Flow of Water Measurement in and around Daitari Iron Ore Mine in
Keonjhar district of Odisha. The data was collected during October 2014, December 2014,
Februray 2015, April 2015 and June 2015. The scope of work within the mine lease area was
confined to Ambient Air Quality (6 locations) ,Work Zone Air Quality ( 6 locations), Ambient
Noise Level (6 locations ) Work zone Noise Level (3 locations) Surface Water Quality (4
locations) and Flow of Water Measurement (3 locations) . In order to assess the pollution level
in and around the mining lease, different environmental attributes such as air quality, water
quality, and noise level were monitored. M/s EDCPL has set up a site laboratory equipped with
99
100
adequate instruments and equipments to monitor and analyze all the parameters of Air Quality
i.e. PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOX & CO and few physic-chemical parameters (10 parameters) of
water samples.

It was found that noise is produced in the mines mainly due to crushing, excavation
process and drilling process. Maximum noise is produced because of crushing followed by
excavation of ores and drilling operations. However as recoded, the level of noise pollution was
above 75 db in the crushing site with a variation from 68 to 77db during the day time. Whereas
in the excavation site and drilling point site, the noise level was within the permissible limit of
75 db.
The table 9 shows the permissible sound pressure level according to CPCB per day
according to number of hours. It was found that in a day for 8 hrs exposure the sound pressure
level allowed should not be more than 90 db, for six hours in a day it should be in the limit of 92
db, for 4 hours exposure the sound pressure level should not exceed 95 db, for three hours in a
day it should not exceed 97 db and for 2 hours a day it should not exceed 100 db.

Suggestions:
There are potential pollution problems with iron mining in Jajpur and keonjhar districts
of Odisha. This includes the loss of wetlands and streams and groundwater and threats from acid
mine drainage. It has affected the ponds and the streams in the area. The presence of pyrite and
other sulfides in the region could be a source of acid mine drainage. When sulfide materials are
exposed to air and waste, they can produce sulfuric acid in the water. Mercury pollution may be
produced in future which may pollute the air and can convert to toxic form in water. The
sulphates in the rocks can pollute the surface water to a larger extent. An open pit mine
"functions as a hydrologic sink drawing groundwater and storm water through cracks in the
bedrock. There may be also change in the drainage pattern in the mining zone. The mine could
lower groundwater around the pit, affecting local wetlands, streams and lakes. Surface water
pollution with excessive silt and soluble Iron occurs from mine run-off. Noise pollution is
because of drilling and blasting operations.
115
116
1. Using latest software to develop the mining plan, there is a need for greater scientific and
systematic mining. The plan should be based on dumping area availability, distance of nearby
villages, optimum use of forest land, necessity of land reclamation, water harvesting for
beneficiation and pollution control. In case of OMC sequential mining can be considered as a
good approach.
2. Surface and groundwater will have to be monitored continuously.
3. The tissue of fish and other aquatic life, bird eggs and sediments will have to be examined for
any potential effects from the mine.
4. The mining operations should be restricted to above ground water table and the operations to
be such that it should not intersect groundwater table.
5. The mining activities should ensure that no natural watercourse or water resources should be
obstructed due to any mining operations. In this regard Guard wall should be provided at the
Bank of Nalla maintaining the safety zone and site specific surface run off management
measures like; de-silting pits, and linear recharge structures, etc. are provided.
6. Over burden should be stacked at earmarked dump sites only and should not be kept active for
long period. The maximum height of the dump should not exceed 30m having three terraces of
10 m each. The overall slope of the dump shall not exceed 27 degree. The OB dump should be
scientifically vegetated with suitable local species to prevent erosion and surface run off.
Monitoring and management of rehabilitated areas should continue until vegetation becomes
self-sustaining. Proper care and survival of sapling should be carried out during upcoming
season. Back-filled area should be reclaimed by plantation. Monitoring and management of
rehabilitated areas should continue until vegetation becomes self-sustaining.
7. Catch drains and siltation ponds of appropriate size should be constructed to arrest silt and
sediment flows from mine working, soil, OB and mineral dumps. The water so collected should
be utilized for watering the mine area, roads, and green belt development etc. The drain should
be regularly desilted particularly after monsoon and maintained properly. Garland drain of
appropriate size, gradient and length should be constructed for mine pit, soil, OB and mineral
dumps and sump capacity should be designed keeping 50% safety margin over and above peak
sudden rainfall and maximum discharge in the area adjoining the mine site. Sump capacity
should also provide adequate retention period to allow proper settling of silt material.
116
117
Sedimentation pits should be constructed at the corners of the garland drains and de-silted at
regular intervals.
8. Dimension of the retaining wall at the toe of the temporary over burden dumps and OB
benches within the mine to check run-off and siltation should be based on the rain fall data.
9. Plantation should be raised including a green belt of adequate width by planting the native
species around the ML area, OB dumps, roads etc. in consultation with the local Forest
Department and Agriculture Department. The density of the trees should be around 2500 plants
per hectare.
10. Regular water sprinkling should be carried out in critical areas prone to air pollution and
having high levels of SPM and RPM such as haul road, loading and unloading point and transfer
points. It should be ensured that the Ambient Air Quality parameters conform to the norms
prescribed by the Central pollution Control Board.
11. Regular water sprinkling should be carried out by engaging no. of water tankers on the
haulage roads for dust suppressions. Fixed - auto water sprinkling arrangement for provided at
mineral dispatch haulage can also be taken up. .
12. Monitoring of AAQ sample should be continued in the core as well as buffer zone and
results should be always within the norms.
13. The OMC should implement suitable conservation measures to augment ground resources in
the area. Retaining wall should be constructed at downstream of dump site to arrest sliding of
wastes.
14. Regular monitoring of ground water level and quality should be carried out in around the
mine lease by establishing a network existing wells and constructing new piezometers during the
mining operation. The monitoring should be carried out four times in a year Pre –monsoon
(April-May), Monsoon (August), Post monsoon (November) and Winter (January).
15. Regular monitoring of ground water level and quality should be carried-out by utilizing the
Piezometers periodically. The data so obtained should be submitted to authorities regularly.
16. Appropriate mitigate measures should be taken to prevent pollution of the rivers in
consultation with the State Pollution Control Board. Site specific mitigation measures to prevent
silt carried into nearby natural water bodies should be implemented like; surface run off
management structures, and guard wall across the bank of the Nalla.
117
118
17. Suitable rainwater harvesting measures on long term basis should be planned and
implemented in consultation with specific agencies like Central Ground Water Board.
18. Vehicular emissions should be kept under control and regularly monitored. Measures Should
be taken for maintenance of vehicles used in mining operations and in transportation of mineral.
The vehicles should be covered with a tarpaulin and should not be overloaded. Preventive
Measures should be taken for maintenance of vehicles used in mining operations and
transportation of mineral.
19. Blasting operation should be carried out only during daytime. Controlled blasting shall be
practiced. The mitigate measures for control of ground vibrations and to arrest fly rocks and
boulders should be implemented using appropriate technology like Nonel technology. The
ground vibrations should be within the norms. Minimate should be used to record the vibrations.
The blasting zone should be provided with siren before blasting operation.
20. Drills should be operated with dust extractors or equipped with water injection system.
Latest technology drilling machine with inbuilt dust extraction system is should be utilized.
21. OMC should take all precautionary measures during mining operation for conservation and
protection of endangered fauna namely elephant and sloth bear spotted in the study area. Action
plan for conservation of flora and fauna should be prepared and implemented in consultation
with the State Forest and Wildlife Department. It should include the cost of implementation of
the plan and Regional Wild life Management Plan for Conservation.
Conclusion:
Iron ores in India are found in Odisha, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Goa,
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharahtra and Jhrakhand. There are nearly 257 iron ore mines in
India. The maximum amount of iron ore extracted is from Chhattisgarh, followed by Goa and
Jharkahand. The production of iron ore during 2017 in India was to the extent of 190 million
metric tons and it is expected to rise in the coming years. It is well known that iron ore mines
contribute substantially for the economy of our country. But it creates adverse effects on the
environment. For every ton of iron ore extracted nearly about two and half tons of wastes are
generated. These wastes when allowed to flow in to the rivers or nallas affect the water quality
and also the aquatic lives. Further the ecology of the total area gets disturbed because of cutting
of the forests, loss of vegetation and the top layer of the soil. This affects the agriculture
adversely. Though every effort is made to maintain the ambient air quality in the work zone and
118
119
also in the vicinity of the mining areas, but it is not possible in large scale mining operations
inspite of the best of efforts. The measures taken to control the flow of mine wastes are not
sufficient. In the absence of proper pollution control measures, the run-offs from the mines
create pollution in the nearby streams as observed through its colour and turbidity. This water
thus becomes unfit for human and animal consumption. Through tailing dams efforts are being
made to settle the iron ore slimes and clear water discharges to down streams. But major effort
is required for recycling of the solid wastes. Reclamation of waste is a way out. There is further
a need for massive afforestation programme to create lush greenery areas which is a prerequisite
sustainable mining operation.

measurements reveal different seasonal characteristics and diurnal patterns. At the seasonal scale, δ18O exhibits a

Taylor (1968) analyzed deuterium in water vapor from the surface to a
5000-m height. White and Gedzelman (1984) found a positive correla-

In the 1980s, a comprehensive sampling program measuring 2H, 18O,
and 3H in surface atmospheric water vapor in Paris, Hannover, Heidel-
berg, Krakow, and Miami found a relationship between variations in
stable isotopes in water vapor and monthly averaged air temperatures
(Schoch-Fischer et al., 1984). Gat et al. (2003) revealed that the isotope
compositions of water vapor over the Mediterranean were affected by
strong air-sea interactions, and the high d-excess (d-excess =δD-8*δ18O)
values were related to low humidity. Recently, continuous measure-

et al., 2017), Siberia (Bastrikov et al., 2014), the Greenland ice sheet
(Bonne et al., 2014; Steen-Larsen et al., 2013), and eastern China (Li
et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2010) have revealed the dominant impact of
local atmospheric humidity at diurnal and intraseasonal scales. Many
studies have also identified the impacts of moisture sources and atmo- Fig. 1. Location of the Lhasa station (star) and schematic representation of the

indicated the possible impact of precipitation events. δD shows similar
variations to those of δ18O (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.01) due to equilibrium
processes. The seasonal pattern of precipitation δ18O also shows the
maximum in May and minimum in August, but without the remarkable
second extrema (Gao et al., 2013, 2018). Such seasonal variability is
associated with the transition between the Indian summer monsoon and
the westerlies (Yao et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2013). The Indian monsoon
brings warm and wet moisture from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea
as well as the tropical Indian Ocean to the TP, resulting in the manifested
depletion of water vapor and precipitation δ18O (Tian et al., 2001, 2020;
Yu et al., 2015a, 2015b), while enrichments in δ18O are exhibited during
the premonsoon and postmonsoon periods. Following previous studies
(e.g., Gao et al., 2018), the values obtained from 1 June to 30 September
during our observation period were selected to reflect the diurnal vari-
ability dominated by the Indian summer monsoon. The October–No-
vember period is considered the postmonsoon period,
December–February is considered the winter period, and the other
months are considered the premonsoon period. However, such W-shape
seasonal variability is different from that in the regions dominated by
the westerlies. Yu (2016) found enriched water vapor δ18O in June-
–August and ~15‰ depletion in December–February at Taxkorgan, the
northern TP, where the westerlies are the dominate circulation all year
round. Bastrikov et al. (2014) depicted the maximum isotopes in August Fig. 3. The local water vapor lines (LWVLs) at Lhasa during the four periods of

total trajectories). The source in the southern Himalayas across Bhutan
contributed the main moisture source to Lhasa, associated with the
highest average water vapor δ18O ((cid:0) 17.4‰). The specific humidity
values along the trajectories of the other two sources were lower than 3
g/kg, associated with low average water vapor δ18O values (less than
(cid:0) 21‰, Fig. 6a). During the monsoon period, the source in the southern
Himalayas, which contributed dominant moisture to Lhasa (91% of the
total trajectories) with a specific humidity greater than 9 g/kg, resulted
in depleted water vapor δ18O ((cid:0) 25.3‰). Such characteristics are
consistent with variations in precipitation stable isotopes due to mois-
ture controlled by the Indian summer monsoon (Gao et al., 2018).
During the postmonsoon period (Fig. 6c), only two sources were clus-
tered. The dominant source (82% to total trajectories), located in the
southern TP along the Himalayas, transports moist air to Lhasa, and the
other source in Irian transported comparatively less moisture overall.
Such changes in moisture sources result in the enrichment of water
vapor δ18O by ~5‰. In winter (Fig. 6d), moisture transport controlled
by the westerlies (Yao et al., 2013) brings dry air with a specific hu-
midity less than 5 g/kg to Lhasa, associated with the lowest average
water vapor δ18O measured throughout the year.
We used q-δ18O plots (Galewsky et al., 2016; Benetti et al., 2018)
combined with theoretical Rayleigh distillation curves and mixing lines
to assess the mixing situations during the four studied periods (Fig. 7).
The theoretical Rayleigh curve was calculated with an initial δ18O value
of (cid:0) 9.3‰, which was equal to the evaporated δ18O in equilibrium with
ocean water at 25 ◦C (RH =80%). The mixing curve is calculated with Fig. 7. Scatter plot of the observed hourly water vapor δ18O vs. q. The solid

Abstract
Air Quality Index near Keonjhar, Odisha was carried out based on monitoring of four ambient air quality parameters like
PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 at eight different locations. Monitoring was carried out for one year starting from March, 2014
February 2015. APM-460 DXNL Respirable Dust Sampler and Fine Particulate Sampler APM-550 were used followed
by cyclonic and impactor based technique for measurement of PM10and PM2.5 respectively. Ambient air samples were
continuously drawn in solution of potassium tetrachloromercurate for SO2 and sodium hydroxide and sodium arsenate
for NO2. Statistical interpretation like ANOVA and DMRT test was done. The evaluation of Air Quality Index is important
because it is a useful tool for the area based management of air pollution followed by subsequent health impact and to
mitigate the pollution level. It is a measure of the ratio of the pollutants concentration to the status of ambient air in
the places. The present investigation shows a significant variation in AQI with respect to variation in both stations and
seasons. Industrial activity, mining activity, mineral transportation and allied activities are the major pollution sources in
the area which determines the ambient air pollution status of the area. It was observed that the causes of variation in AQI
in the study are multi-faced. As per AQI category most of the stations are either coming under light air pollution category
or moderately air pollution category. As there is no literature available on the AQI study of the area, it can be used as a
reference for future research in the area.

RESEARCH PAPER
Health Damages from Air Pollution: Evidence from
Opencast Coal Mining Region of Odisha, India
Tapaswini Nayak  and Indrani Roy Chowdhury 
Abstract: The present study examines the productive day‘s loss of local
communities in the opencast coal mining region of Angul (Talcher) district in
Odisha, due to respiratory illness, by using the dose-response function model. The
productive day‘s loss is estimated in terms of restricted activities or work days lost,
due to severe respiratory illness (RI), induced by air pollution. Health diaries are
analyzed through the seasonal household survey to predict the likelihood of RI-
related sickness (in terms of the restricted days) of the residents of the mining
region (due to air pollution). Poisson and negative binomial regression are fitted for
the purpose of count data analysis. The regression result confirms that there is a
positive and significant relationship between the level of air pollution (respiratory
suspended particulate matter (RSPM)/particulate matter less than 10 g/m3(PM10)
and RI-related sick days, depicting that a reduction in air pollution level (PM10)
may cause a reduction in expected number of RI-related sick days in the coal
mining region. Further monetary welfare gain from avoiding the RI-related sick
days are estimated for the population of Talcher coal mining area, Odisha.
Keywords: Air pollution; respiratory illness; health diaries; dose-response function;
count data regression.

poor education. This is the well-documented ‘resource curse‘ or ‗paradox of
plenty‘ (Sachs and Warner 1997, 2001). Balancing efficient utilization of
mineral resources with ensuring equitable and sustainable development and
safeguarding the local environment and societal well-being is often a
challenge.

In the post-liberalization period, many Indian states are encountering a
voracious appetite for energy and infrastructure. The intense interstate
competitions trigger the demand for energy and infrastructure, which is
needed to attract investment to boost growth. This appetite has led to the
rampant extraction and utilization of mineral resources in these states.
Mining activities are often accompanied by a drastic jump in mineral rich
pollution load (both air and water pollution), widespread soil degradation
and forest cover loss (State of Environment Report 2008; David Stuligross
1999).
The state of Odisha is mineral-rich. In the post-reform period, Odisha and
other mineral-rich states have been struggling to answer a difficult question:
should they intensify their extraction of mineral resources in their quest for
a high rate of growth at the cost of their environment?
Odisha is blessed with an abundance of mineral reserves — 24 per cent of
India‘s coal reserves, 17 per cent of iron ore, 98 per cent of chromite, 51
per cent of bauxite, 35 per cent of manganese, and 92 per cent of nickel ore
(Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15). The state has the second largest
reserve of coal in India. The share of mining in Odisha‘s gross state
domestic product (GSDP) has escalated significantly to 7 per cent of GSDP
in 2014–15 (Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15). The state ranks first in
[45] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
country in terms of value of coal reserves and extraction. The state has
witnessed an unprecedented increase in coal production from 8 million tons
in 2003–04 to 60 million tons in 2013–14. Figures 1 and 2 depict the
production recent growth trends of major mineral resources in Odisha.
Coal alone accounted for 70 per cent

Odisha is one of the richest
biodiversity regions in South-East Asia
(State of the Environment Report
Odisha 2007). In terms of mineral
deposits and production, the state
occupies a vital position in the country
(Murthy and Rao 2006; Economic
Survey of Odisha 2014–15). The
Source: Odisha Economic survey,
strong performance of the mining
2014-15
sector in terms of both production and
value has thus resulted in a significant growth of the state‘s average GSDP
(Economic Survey of Odisha 2014–15). The investment share of the mining
sector in total outstanding investments makes Odisha the fifteenth highest
recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) among all Indian states. The
mining revenue receipt has been steadily increasing over the past decade
(Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15).
A report by the State of Environment (2008) has declared all the coal belts
of the state most unsafe for human health and living conditions. The
neighbourhood of the coal belt witnesses alarmingly high concentration of
suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RPM)
exceeding the national standard level by several folds. Moreover, WHO
(2002) suggests that coal mining process which release toxic pollutants can
adversely affect the air quality in the surrounding environment.
Coal is an important source of fuel and power and is therefore critically
important for the growth and development of a transition economy like
Odisha‘s. Moreover, coal has the highest forward linkage with a number of
other industries. Therefore, extraction of coal is an attractive option for a
state for the creation of direct and indirect employment opportunities,
foreign exchange earnings through FDI, generation of mineral royalties, tax
revenues, etc. However, coal production is treated as ‗dirty industry‘ as it is
the most polluting natural resource (Elizabeth and York 2012; Michelle
2014). Apart from the direct impact of the occupational hazards of the coal
miners, coal mining activities, particularly open cast coal mining, imposes
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [46]
highly negative environmental externalities (through air pollution, water
pollution, contamination and loss of fertility of land, and forest loss and
degradation) and health externalities (in terms of poor quality of health
among the local communities, living in the proximity of opencast coal
mining region). Mining and extraction activities create irreversible damages
to the local environment, having long-run future consequences. From
mining to combustion of coal, all the intervening processes release various
toxic pollutants (such as RSPM (PM )), carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide (SO )
10 2
which adversely affect the air quality in the surrounding environment
(WHO 2002). These huge amounts of wastages and pollutants (along with
fly ash, coal dust, and heat) have dangerous health impact for the human
beings living in the neighbourhood. Thus, from the policy perspective, or
for state planning, it poses a serious challenge, in terms of a trade-off
between the overall growth and development of the state vis-a-vis
environmental degradation and health concerns of the local communities.
Given the economic importance of coal, for a state like Odisha, forgoing
the mineral extraction activities implies forgoing immediate opportunities
for the entire state seems exorbitantly costly at the present stage of its
development. As a consequence, the environment and health concerns of
local communities in the mining region remain on the back burner.
Opencast coal mining leads to more severe air pollution than underground
mining (Ghose and Banerjee 1995). All the mining processes, starting from
drilling to transportation and screening, are the major sources of such
emissions (Pathak et al. 2007). Air pollution in opencast coal mines is mainly
due to the toxic emission of particulate matter and gases including methane,
sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. These air pollutants reduce air
quality and ultimately affect people around mining areas (Nanda and Tiwari
2001). The major air pollutants produced by opencast coal mining are SPM
and RPM (Sinha and Banerjee 1997; CMRI 1998). Mine fire is also
considered as a major source of air pollution in some of the coalfields. The
problems may have local, regional, and global impacts. Dust generated by
opencast coal mining also affects agricultural productivity (Mishra 2008).
Several research findings (Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010) show
high concentrations of lower atmospheric pollution, especially
RSPM(PM ), adversely contribute to human morbidity, increase respiratory
10
syndromes, and reduce lung functions. Longer term exposure to air
pollution (PM ) may lead to irritation, asthma, high blood pressure and
10
heart diseases (Pope et al. 1995, 2007). High concentration of RSPM
increase respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and bronchial cases,
while gaseous emissions contribute towards global warming, acid rain, and
ground-level ozone besides causing health hazards to the exposed
[47] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
population (Pathak et al. 2007). Therefore, health risk and morbidity due to
air pollution is high where opencast coal mining is predominant. Pattanayak
et al. (2011) also observe that in Keonjhar, Odisha, local communities are
vulnerable to diseases such as acute respiratory illness (RI), gastric,
tuberculosis, and skin diseases, due to high exposure to toxic elements. All
these health problems no doubt have economic costs arising from the
expenses incurred in treating the diseases and productive days lost (Ostro
1994; Banerjee 2001).
Traditionally, opportunity costs of human health was interpreted solely on
account of the individual‘s physical well-being without considering the
environmental and social backgrounds around him (Rapport and Mergler
2004). From the 1970s, there has been a departure from the traditional
belief, and ‗health‘ is recognized as a precious asset in itself and an
absolutely essential ingredient for human development and productivity
(Grossman 1972). Good health with mental well-being is termed both a
‗resource‘ and ‗means‘ for stimulating economic development, and an
outcome of economic development (Brundtland 2002); the WHO (2005)
argues that ‗quality of health‘ is related not only to freedom from diseases
but also associated with a healthy and hygienic environment.
Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the linkages between health and
the environment in the opencast coal mining area in Angul district of
Odisha. This linkage paves the pathway for the significance of
environmental quality in determining the quality of health and well-being.
Given the enormous economic cost involved in terms of productive days
lost and treatment of RI-related diseases caused by coal-mining activity, it is
critically important to estimate the health impact of air pollution in the
opencast coal mining region.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section
3 explains the dose-response methodology that depicts the association
between human health and air pollution. Section 4 presents the household
survey design. Section 5 describes the econometric methodology. Section 6
presents the empirical estimation of RI-related sick days and discusses the
regression results. Section 7 discusses the evaluation of the welfare gain of
air pollution reduction. Finally, Section 8 presents the main findings and
conclusions.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The seminal work by Grossman (1972) pioneered the formulation of a
theoretical model of household production function. He analyses the
demand for health by developing human capital model, where he suggests
‗health‘ as a durable human capital stock and medical care as an important
factor in its production. Cropper (1981) added pollution as a crucial
ingredient and calculated the health damage reduction from the reduction in
the air pollution level. Ostro (1994) suggests the a three-step method of
calculating the health benefits of reducing air pollution. The first is to find
out the dose-response relationship that shows the health outcome of air
pollution. The second is to set the target group population, who are
victimized, and exposed to the specific air pollution effect. The third is to
calculate the change in air pollution level by implementing a specific
pollution-reducing technique.
The more recent studies have attempted to explore a relationship between
air pollution and the occurrence of illness by using dose-response and
damage functions, while some economists have calculated the health
damage cost of air pollution levels using one of three methods: cost-of-
illness (COI), dose-response, and contingency valuation (Alberini et al. 1997;
Ostro 1994; Krupanik 2000). In the case of South Asia, Murty et al. (2003)
and Gupta (2008) calculated the health benefits from the reduction in urban
air pollution level in the Indian states. Mishra (2012) estimated the damage
to human health and agricultural productivity loss from pollution induced
by coal-mining activities in Odisha. Chaulya (2003) shows that the annual
average SPM and RSPM (PM ) concentration in the Ib valley coalfield of
10
Odisha exceeds the standards set in the Indian National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) protocol for both residential and industrial
areas. The problem is not limited to these areas alone; air ambient quality is
critical in the state‘s entire mining belt.
The literature on estimating the morbidity and health impact costs are
mostly confined to urban air pollution, vehicular pollution, etc. There are
some studies on the health impact of air pollution in the cement industry
(Bogahawatte 2008) and iron mining (Pattanayak et al. 2011), and of the
occupational hazards (i.e., direct impact) of coal mining (Sarkar et al. 2004),
but there are only a few studies to the best of our knowledge on the health
impact of air pollution induced by opencast coal mining in Odisha (Mishra
2012; Singh et al. 2010; Hota and Mishra 2010). Most studies address the
health concerns from air pollution and the pollution load in coal mining
areas, but they do not address many important questions.
[49] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
Therefore, this study tries to bridge the research gap by examining the
association between the air pollution level and negative health outcomes
(we consider RI for this study)1 in the opencast coal mining region (Angul-
Talcher) of Odisha. This study also tries to analyse the economic impact of
negative health effects by considering the loss of wages of productive days
for the study region.

We raise some unanswered questions. (1) To what extent does the coal
mining activities contributed to the health-related well-being of the local
community in the mining region and to their environment? (2) Does the
critical ambient air quality near the opencast coal belt matter to the health
of the neighbouring community? (3) How do the socio-economic factors
affected the health stock of the local communities in the neighbourhood of
coal mining areas? (4) How many productive days are lost by the local
communities due to RI related diseases on account of such negative
externalities ?
Against this backdrop, the study area is located in a coal mining district
Angul of Odisha, in the eastern part of India. The state has two coalfields
namely- Talcher coalfield (in Angul district) and lb River coalfield (in
Jharsuguda district).The coalfield of Ib valley is comparatively new
compared to that of Talcher coal field(Directorate of Mines, Government
of Odisha, Bhubaneswar). The older the coal mines project, the more is its
environmental impact. The numbers of active opencast coal mine projects
are also larger in Talcher coal field area than the IB valley coal field. As per
the latest report by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB 2009) on
Comprehensive Environment Assessment of Industrial Clusters, Talcher
coal filed region of Odisha has secured seventh position as one of the most
1 RI includes all the common acute syndromes of respiratory diseases such as: bronchial
asthma, cough with mucus, and sputum production, respiration allergy to dust, allergic
cough, running nose, headache, flu, and fever, chest tightness, pain, and acute bronchitis.
These symptoms are identified as commonly reported respiratory illness after consulting the
specialist doctors from the Mahanadi Coal Field Hospital, located in the study region.

3. DEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN
RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND AIR POLLUTION: DOSE-
RESPONSE FUNCTION
Often, the relationship between air pollution and premature mortality is
studied by using time-series analysis of daily observations of number of
deaths and the pollution level. These studies capture the effects of the
short-term exposure to pollution on the probability of dying. But it is
expected that people, who are in a weak physical state or who have a history
of chronic diseases are more susceptible to contact recurring diseases due to
the high concentration of pollution in the environment and are therefore
supposed to be the most vulnerable. These types of exposure can be
captured through the ‘dose-response function‘. If there is a cause of high
2 The concentration of PM 10 in air is very high for the study region which often exceeds the
prescribed level (by Central Pollution Control Board) by two folds. See the table no (1) and
(2) for detail about the severity of air pollution.
3 See Figure 3 for the district wise extraction and value of coal in Odisha in recent year.
[51] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
concentration of pollutants in the surrounding environment, then it may
trigger some negative health outcome (i.e., negative externalities of
environmental pollution) as its effect. This association between cause and
effect has been known as ‗dose-response function‘.4
This function captures a range of responses towards the respiratory illness
of different individuals due to different degree of outdoor pollutants, when
other confounding socio-economic factors and the level of indoor pollution
are controlled. This function therefore relates the importance of a ‗Dose‘
(that is the intensity of air pollution to which the local people are exposed)
to the ‗responsiveness‘ of the individuals (the response may be any kind of
morbidity due to the respiratory diseases, stress, and even death or
mortality). The degree of impact can be captured as the proportion or the
days of sickness or restricted activity days due to respiratory illness
syndromes (H).This method estimates the partial derivative (or the slope of
b) of ‗Dose-Response‘ function as given in the following equation (1). The
purpose is to calculate the marginal effect of a change in occurrence of a
given health outcome related to a change in air ambient quality (A) with
other confounding factors.

2013-14 (Quantity in lakh MT and value in crore of rupees)
Source: Odisha Economy survey, 2014-15
The next step by Ostro (1994) is to calculate the numbers of people who
are supposed to be exposed to the particular air pollution effect (i.e.
POPi).Then how many productive days (restricted activity days or sick
days), they are losing because of the exposure. Finally, the last step is to
4See Ostro (1983, 1987, 1994), who estimated the ‗Dose-Response Function‘ to find out the
impact of air pollution on morbidity and found that PM , affect both the restricted activity
10
days and work days lost.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [52]
calculate the welfare gain due to a unit change or reduction in ambient air
quality (dA).
Thus the dose-response function can be expressed as (following Ostro
1994):
dH b*POP*dA (1)
i i
Where,dH = change in individual‘s risk of health outcome i
i
b= slope from the ‗dose-response‘ function.
POP = targeted population at risk of health impact i
i
dA = change in ambient air quality under consideration
4. SURVEY DESIGN
The present study is based on the primary survey at the household level,
though pollution data are collected from the secondary sources such as
State Pollution Control Board, Odisha and Regional Pollution Control
Board, Angul. To understand the severity of air pollution on the health
outcome of the local residents we first conducted a pilot survey followed by
five rounds of group discussions during September 2015. Baseline
information was collected from that pilot survey from some randomly
selected households in the vicinity of Mahanadi Coal Field Limited. The
baseline information did confirm the severity of health problem in the
region. To capture the exposure of air pollution on human health (for those
who are residing near the coal field area) through ‗dose-response‘ method,
we required background information on the health status of individuals
residing in the study region along with other environmental and socio-
economic information. The pilot survey helped us to design a well-
structured questionnaire for the final survey. We conducted the survey
during September 2015 to January 2016, involving (210) households of the
10 neighbouring villages, of Angul-Talcher opencast coal mining region of
Mahanadi Coal Field Limited (MCL). Following Krupanick (2000), Gupta
(2008), Murty et al. (2003), Adhikari (2012) and Imran et al. (2010), the
survey kept track of weekly health diary of the selected households for six
weeks extended over two seasons. We followed two stage stratification, for
selecting sample (following Gupta 2006 and Adhikari 2012). The reason for
following a two stage stratification sampling procedure is to capture
precisely the local people‘s exposure to air pollution and the consequent
adverse health impact. In the first stage of stratification, the villages within a
four-kilometre radius from the air pollution monitoring station were
identified (and a total 10 villages were selected. We then randomly selected
[53] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
21 households from each village. Thus a total of (21 x 10 = 210)
households from 10 villages and an aggregate of 855 members were
surveyed5. Out of 855 household members 254 members were suffering
from RI symptoms during the first round of the survey. Given the seasonal
differentiates in air quality levels, we collected health diary information on
254 household members repeatedly for six weeks during two different
seasons (i.e. October or post-monsoon and December or winter). The
health diaries covered the RI-related health status, of mitigating
expenditure, chronic illness etc. Therefore the survey resulted in a pooled
data, containing 1524 (= 254 x 6) observations. But by using the Stata
software 12.0, we found only 932(restrictive sample) observations having RI
diseases, sick days, and mitigating expenses over the entire 6 weeks. Given
that the present study is focused on the number of RI-related sick days, so a
total of 932 observations on the basis of availability of full information
could only be taken for empirical investigation.
5. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATION OF RI-RELATED SICK DAYS
Our goal is to estimate the number of sick days or restricted activity days of
a person suffering from respiratory diseases. This dependent variable
counts the duration of sickness episode which is related to the particular
respiratory syndromes (associated with air pollution) based on one week
recall period6.The dependent variable counts how many days in a week
(based on one week recall period), an individual is unable to work or
restricted from other activities due to respiratory illness. As our dependent
variable i.e., ‗sick days‘ is finite number of non-negative integers (small
discrete values, say 0 1 2, 3, 4, …) or count values, assuming 0 values in
several observations, we need a probability distribution that takes care of
this count data. We used the Poisson and Negative Binomial regression to
model the count outcomes i.e., the negative health impacts of air pollution
(captured by the number of restricted activity days) as experienced by the
respondent in a given time period.
5 The sampling framework takes into account the randomly selected households from each
of the 10 villages, which are located within a stipulated area i.e., 4 km radius surrounding the
station. So the selection bias is likely to be minimum and therefore can be comfortably
ignored. Here proximity is used to identify the neighbourhood areas which are very close
within the radius of 4 km from the opencast coal mines.
6 For the primary survey we collected information regarding the prevalence of RI-related
diseases and the mitigating expenditure incurred by the household and therefore we set the
recall period of one week. This is deliberately done to extract correct information on the
mitigating expenditure data.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [54]
Given that Poisson regression is the starting point of count data analysis,
we initially fitted the Poisson regression to the number of sick days by using
the method of Pseudo Maximum Likelihood Estimation or Quasi-
Maximum likelihood estimation. It is possible to write the probability of
number of sick days(Y) for a respective individual, using the Poisson
regression model as:
Prob. 

Y 



it
eit
,y 0,1,23,...7.... (2)
  it x   y ! it

whereex
i
Here y denotes the RI-related sick days or restricted activity days (related
it
to air pollution level) for an individual i at time period t. ‗e‘ is the exponential
function of y  , the mean value of the number of sick days due to
it it
pollution.  is the vector of regression coefficients while x is the vector
it
of independent variables. And u is the unobserved error term that may
it
affect the individual health stock.
The estimated mean value is therefore: ˆ eˆx. A log transformation gives
t
the equation: lnˆ ˆx
i
As the count data variance usually exceeds the mean, the Poisson model has
its limitation arising from the property of equi-dispersion. Alternatively we
also run the negative binomial model (NBM) as an alternative model which
accounts for the overdispersion in count data, when the conditional
variance surpasses the conditional mean. The only difference between two
is that NBM has an ancillary parameter (α) to model the overdispersion.
5.1. Choice Variables
The vector of explanatory variables comprises of daily PM data obtained
10
from the nearest air pollution monitoring station from the respondents'
residence. The study has narrowed down the ‗daily (PM )‘ as the single-
10
most important indicator for air pollution in the coal belt, as the exposure
to PM is considered to be most damaging impact on respiratory health
10
(Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010).7
7 Several research findings show high concentrations of lower atmospheric pollution
especially RSPM (PM ) contribute to human morbidity, increase respiratory syndromes, and
10
reduced lung functions (Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010). The secondary data on
air pollution shows that in open cast coal mining areas in Odisha, the PM level is

10As discussed, coal is one of the most polluting natural resources (because it emits toxic
pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, respiratory suspended particulate matters
etc. to atmosphere). The brittle nature of coal creates coal dust in the coal mining activities
including loading unloading, transportation etc. In the open cast coal mining neighbourhood
villages, the suspended coal dusts often create haze in the atmosphere which often interrupts
visibility. Given these facts it is evident that regular exposure of the air borne contaminants
due to coal and coal dust may trigger respiratory illness. It is anticipated that more outdoor
exposure may increase the probability of illness. The exposure to coal dust is a dummy
variable which assigns 1 if the representative individual is exposed to outdoor coal dust (or
stay in outdoor more than 1 hour a day), otherwise it is 0 (zero).

6. REGRESSION ANALYSIS
The regression result of the Poisson and NBMs are given in Tables 5 and 6,
which display the regression coefficients, standard errors, and probability
values (z>p) for each explanatory variable.
In table (5) and (6), both the regression model (Poisson and NB) present
approximately similar results, because the ‗α‘ value (the parameter which
accounts for overdispersion) is very small (i.e., - 0.0103) in NBM. The only
difference is that the Poisson model gives the robust standard error (as it is
based on pseudo maximum likelihood method and the NBM accounts the
overdispersion as it has one ancillary parameter i.e., α.
The regression results confirms our hypothesis that there is a positive and
significant relationship between the level of air pollution (RSPM/PM ) and
10
RI-related sick days. The coefficient of PM (0.0059) is positive and
10
statistically significant at 1 per cent level of significance (p-value is 0.001 or
equivalently t-value is 4.22) in the Poisson model. The positive coefficient
of pollution variable depicts that a reduction in air pollution level (PM
10
level) will cause a reduction in expected number of RI-related sick days. The
coefficient of awareness regarding pollution related health impact is
negative and significant at 1 per cent level; showing a decrease in sick days
due to the rise in awareness level. The coefficient of chronic diseases
asthma is positive and significant at 1 per cent level, thereby presenting an
increase in sick days as the chronic asthma increases. The other socio-
economic and control variables such as individual smoking habits, coal-
fuel12 and illness in previous week have positive coefficients as expected
and are also statistically significant.13
The coal as a daily household fuel has been controlled for indoor air
pollution. This variable is statistically significant and positive impact on
aggravating the respiratory illness and its related sick days. The individuals
who have active smoking habits are more susceptible to the exposure of air
pollution and thus respiratory illness related sick days increases for them.
12 The frequency of using ‗coal‘ as a cooking fuel contributes to the level of indoor air
pollution. The study assumes it as a dummy variable giving the value 1 if a representative
household uses coal for their cooking regularly. Here, we consider if a household uses coal
as a fuel for cooking more than 20 times in a month, then we take the value 1 and it takes 0
otherwise.
13 We have checked the multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity test for the model after
running the regression and found these problems among the independent variables are not a
serious concern for the model. The Wald chi2 (15) is 95.28 with p-value 0.000, which
indicates the model is significant as a whole.
[59] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
The presence of respiratory illness in the previous week among the
individual increases the risk of experiencing more RI-related sick days.

7. WELFARE GAIN (IN MONETARY TERMS) OF THE
REDUCTION IN RI-RELATED SICK DAYS
To estimate the monetary benefits from the reduction in RI-related sick
days, we calculate the marginal effect from the Poisson regression. Marginal
effect defines the reduction in RI-related sick days due to the fall in PM
10
levels in air.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [60]
Following Gupta (2006), Chowdhury and Imran (2010) and Adhikari
(2012), monetary benefits from reduction in RI-related sick days can be
expressed as:
365
PM  (3)
10 7
Where  is the coefficient value of PM from Poisson regression model (β
10
= 0.0059)
λ is the predicted value of (H) or RI sick days from the Poisson model (λ =
0.0205)
(λ= 0.0205, is the predicted value of sick days from the Poisson model,
which is calculated by the help of post-regression analysis command in
Stata-12.0)
∆PM is the change in the level of PM from the current to the safe
10 10
standard prescribed level, (the average current level PM in two seasons is
10
159 µg /m3 and the prescribed standard level by Odisha Pollution Control
Board (OPCB) is 90.4 µg /m3 for residential area.)
(β * λ) is the marginal gain from Poisson estimation or (0.0059 * 0.0205 =
0.00012)
The Poisson regression result shows that 1 µg /m3 reduction in PM results
10
in a marginal benefit of 0.00012(days) for a representative household
member in a week. In order to calculate the welfare gain in sick days for a
representative household member by reduction in PM to a safe level, we
10
have to multiply the marginal benefit value by ΔPM i.e., 0.00012 * 68.6 =
10
0.00823 as gain in reduction in sick days for a representative household
member. The annual benefit in monetary terms or welfare gain can be
365
calculated by multiplying this value 0.00823 with the i.e., 0.4292 as
7
annual monetary benefit for reduction in sick days due to reduction in PM
10
level or improvement of PM .
10
Putting the values in equation (3)
0.0059 * 0.0205 * 68.6 * 52.14 = (0.43) days per year for a representative
household member.
Here: β = 0.0059, λ = 0.0205, ΔPM = 159 µg /m3 - 90.4 µg /m3 = 68.6 µg
10
365
/m3 and 52.14.

[61] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
The calculated average wage (per monthly) of working individual is Rs. 275
from working group sample from the survey data. Thus the annual
monetary gain for a representative household member is 0.43 * 275=
Rs.118.25 by avoiding the RI-related sick days due to reduction in PM
10
level. By extrapolating for the total population of Talcher coal mining area,
the monetary welfare gain from avoiding the RI-related sick days are
estimated as Rs. 64, 95,51,5.66 per annum.
However our study presents lower bound estimation of monetary welfare
gain (of health improvement) from the reduction in air pollution in the
opencast coal mining of MCL of Talcher area. The study has the limitation
of not capturing the averting expenditure of air pollution and the
opportunity cost of time spent for seeking care. It poses a serious constraint
to gather information on these variables from the survey because of the
heterogeneity of the respondents (covering children, women, and old
persons other than the working people). Moreover the region is endowed
with some active public health centres run by MCL, offering some basic
health services to the local community. The out of pocket expenditure
which was captured during the survey was mainly the expense incurred by
the residents from the private consultation over and above the free services
they can avail from primary healthcare centres (PHC). The compulsion to
visit the private practitioner was mainly due to congestion, long waiting
time, recurrence, lack of doctor, non-availability of medicine etc., as
reported in the survey.
8. CONCLUSION
For developmental processes, the economic importance of coal is
undoubtedly very high, being the cheapest source of energy. However coal
is the most polluting natural resource; from production to combustion it
leads to the emissions of various harmful gases including methane (CH ),
4
sulfur dioxide (SO ), and nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon monoxide (CO),
2 x
particulate matter, various toxins, etc. Besides coal dust, coal wastes, and
coal particles are produced during the mining process, soot is released
during the transportation of coal. It is evident from various studies that all
these pollutants can cause severe and potentially deadly respiratory and lung
problems, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, apart from the direct impact
of the occupational hazards of the coal miners, coal mining activities
(particularly opencast coal mining), imposes highly negative environmental
externalities (through air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination and
fertility loss and forest loss and degradation) and health externalities (in
terms of poor quality of health among the local communities, living in the
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [62]
proximity of opencast coal mining region). Although there is huge
economic cost involved in tackling these environmental and health
externalities,14 it is seldom addressed seriously at the policy level or in the
implementation stage. Thus the pricing of coal involves huge cross-
subsidies in India from the unaccounted environmental and health
damages. Even the conservative attempt of imputing these negative
externalities in the pricing of coal would have increased the price of coal
several folds.
This primary concern of this paper has been on the impact of air pollution
on respiratory health (in terms of their number of sick days or restricted
days due to RI) among the residents of some coal mining regions of
Odisha. The attempt is to capture the partial impact of air pollution
(triggered by coal production) on respiratory health damages. Given that
the level of PM is always at an alarming level in the Angul-Talcher coal
10
mining region, it is natural to expect that the respiratory health outcome
would be very pervasive and critical in the proximity of the coal field. It is
evident from the literature that the critical air pollution level (particularly
concentration of PM in air) affects the respiratory health status (lung and
10
chest problems, cough, bronchial asthma, bronchitis, TB and other lung
related diseases) of the residents in the proximity of the coal field.
Our empirical exercise predict the likelihood of RI-related sickness (in
terms of their restricted days/sick days) of the residents near the open cast
coal mines (due to air pollution). We find there is a strong and direct
relation between acute respiratory disease related sick days or restricted
activity days and the level PM (air pollution) in Angul-Talcher coal mining
10
area. The positive value of the coefficient of pollution variable depicts that
a reduction in air pollution level (PM level) causes a reduction in expected
10
number of RI-related sick days. We find that a representative individual in
the Angul-Talcher region can save 0.43 days or Rs. 118. 25 by avoiding the
14 See Epstein et al. (2011, 92). At the Center for Health and the Global Environment,
Harvard Medical School, Dr. Paul Epstein and others found that accounting for the full
costs of coal would double or triple its price. The study, released in the Annals of the New
York Academy of Sciences, tallied the economic, health, and environmental costs associated
with each stage in the life cycle of coal—extraction, transportation, processing, and
combustion—and estimated those costs, which are borne by the public at large, at USD
175–500 billion annually. Air pollutants from combustion accounted for USD 187.5 billion,
mercury impacts as much as USD 29.3 billion. The report estimated the public health
burden in Appalachian communities at USD 74.6 billion a year, and that death, injury, and
increased healthcare costs constituted much of the impact. The study discussed several other
impacts that are not easily quantified: coal mining and processing releases heavy metal toxins
and carcinogens into water supplies; coal miners die at work or are injured; and coal mining
societies are impacted.

RI-related sick days, if there is a reduction of 68.6 µg /m3 of PM per year.
10
This is calculated by taking the difference between the average current level
of PM in the two seasons (i.e. 159 µg /m3) and the standard level (i.e., 90.4
10
µg /m3) as prescribed by the OPCB. Thus the monetary welfare gain from
avoiding the RI-related sick days for the entire population of Talcher coal
mining area are estimated to be Rs. 64, 95,515. 66 per annum. Although the
study derives the lower bound estimates of monetary gain due to the
reduction in air pollution, the figures bears some serious policy concerns.

PM Measurement
The sampling units were attached with Teflon tubing to pumps (SKC, Eighty Four, PA)
running at 2 liters per minute. Sampling flow rates were measured thrice prior to the start of
sampling and thrice when the sampling unit was removed using VWR acrylic flow meter #97004-
644 (VWR, Radnor, PA). Flow rate was calculated as the average of the pre-flow and post-flow
averages. The volume of air sampled was calculated by multiplying the flow rate by the total
pump run time. The weight of accumulated particles was calculated by subtracting the weight of
the filter before exposure from the weight of the filter after sampling, with each measurement
done in triplicate on a microbalance that was zeroed between filters. At high filter loadings,
collection efficiency will increase. Three samples were not included in the data analysis due to a
negative net filter weight; 5 were excluded because the pump was stopped when the sample was
collected due to filter loading. The PM concentration was calculated as the weight of
2.5
accumulated particles divided by the volume of air sampled.
Finally, outdoor ambient PM exposure was measured over 24 hours at one randomly
2.5
selected household in each village via a sampling unit placed on the roof of a house; therefore,
nine outdoor samples were collected, ranging from 10 to 170 µg/m3. One sample was dropped
due to missing weight data.
Filters were sealed in cassettes after pre-weighing and after exposure in the field, and
frozen at -20°C after being returned to Duke University.
PAH Measurement
The PAH methods were developed in-house. They are modified (to extract filters instead
of sediment) from those used by Clark et al. (2013). Dried air filter samples containing the
collected particulates were cut in half and weighed. For PAH extraction, half of each filter
S-2
sample was placed in a glass centrifuge tube with 1:1 acetone: hexane and spiked with a surrogate
standard mix containing 6 deuterated PAHs (D10-2-methylnaphthalene, D10-fluorene, D10-
fluoranthene, D12-chrysene, D12-perylene, and D12-indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene) to assess
recoveries. Samples were extracted by sonication, and the extract was concentrated to 0.2-0.5 mL
using rapid evaporation under N2 (SpeedVac (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY, USA). Extracts
were cleaned with solid phase extraction using activated silica and eluted with hexane. Purified
extracts were concentrated under N2 to approximately 0.5 mL, and spiked with an internal
standard mix containing D8-naphthalene, D10-anthracene, D10-pyrene, D12-benz[a]anthracene,
and D12-benzo[a]pyrene. Prior to extraction, samples were randomized and split into 15 test
batch sets. Each batch set included blanks (n=3), a matrix spike containing 100 µL of a PAH
calibration standard (n=6) and extracted alongside samples, and a quality assurance/quality
control sample consisting of an autosampler vial containing all surrogates, internal standards, and
amount of PAH standard used for the matrix spike.
Samples were analyzed for 35 PAHs by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS;
Agilent GC 6890N, MS 5975C mass selective detector. Agilent Newark, DE) in electron
ionization mode (GC/EIMS) using select ion monitoring and pulsed splitless injection at 250 °C.
Analytes were separated on a DB-5 column (30 m, 0.25 µm film thickness) using a thermal
gradient (40 °C for 0.6 min, increase to 280 °C over 14.6 min, hold at 280 °C for 24 min).
GC/MS data were quantified using MSD chemstation software, and for each batch, samples were
blank-corrected by subtracting the average value of the blanks. Method detection limits (MDLs)
were calculated for each PAH (MDL= (3* standard deviation of the analyte in the 3
blanks)/(average sample mass)). PAH samples with values that were <MDL were replaced with
MDL/2 for statistical calculations.
S-3
Water Soluble Organic Carbon and Nitrogen
The concentration of WSOC and WSON (mass divided by total air sampled) as well as
the fraction of total particulate that was WSOC or WSON were analyzed.
Prior to sample extraction, 24 mL glass vials were thoroughly rinsed well with tap water,
NanoUV water (Barnstead Infinity™ Ultrapure Water System, Thermo Scientific, 17.3 MΩcm-1)
then placed in an acid bath of 5% HCl and rinsed three additional times with NanoUV water. The
vials were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne™, Thermo
Scientific) overnight to remove any organic matter remaining on the glassware. This protocol was
applied to all glassware used during the experiment, while all other materials that came into
contact with the filters were washed in a hot soap and water bath, then rinsed with water, then
acetone (BDH, ASC Grade). Sub-samples were collected from each Teflon filter using an arch
punch (C.S. Osborne & CO.) of 3/8” diameter. Each sub-sample was added to a pre-cleaned 24
mL glass vial and materials were re-cleaned to avoid cross contamination between samples, as
described above. After the sample collection, 15 mL of NanoUV water was added to each vial
using a volumetric pipette. To ensure the sample was completely embedded in the water, needles
(BD PrecisionGlide™) were used to push the filters below the meniscus. The needles were held
above the water by placing the end of the needle into a piece of Parafilm, which was wrapped
around the neck of the vial. Sub-samples then were subjected to sonication for 30 minutes
(Branson 8510 Ultrasonic Cleaner). Teflon filters (Pall Corporation) were prepared and treated in
an identical way as a method blank. Samples were analyzed using a total carbon analyzer (TOC-
V , Shimadzu). An ASI-V autosampler was used to inject the samples into the TOC interface.
CHS
A calibration curve was generated through a series of auto dilutions from a 10ppm stock solution
of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP, Fisher Scientific) using the TOC Control-V software.
NanoUV water samples were run to assess the concentrations of dissolved organics in the water
S-4
and 5ppm check standards of KHP were run every 10 samples to assess the variability in the TOC
measurements. The remaining fractions from the TOC analysis were diluted by adding 8 mL of
NanoUV water to the each vial using a volumetric pipette and analyzed using a total nitrogen-
measuring unit (TNM, Shimadzu). A calibration curve was generated through a series of auto
dilutions from a 20ppm stock solution of glutamic acid. Glutamic acid and EDTA were check
standards in this analysis. Check standards were run after every 10 samples. Filter loadings were
determined by scaling the surface area of the sub-samples to the total surface area of the samples.
Five samples were unable to be analyzed; 93 filters were analyzed for WSOC and WSON
mass. Samples with WSOC or WSON as a fraction of total PM that exceeded 100% were
dropped leaving a 68 WSOC and 88 WSON.
Spirometry
The spirometer was calibrated daily using a 3L syringe (MicroLoop Spirometer,
CareFusion, San Diego, CA). Spirometry was conducted on participants while sitting and
wearing a nose clip, or pinching nose closed if facial jewelry interfered with the clip. Subjects
completed at the spirometry test at least three times. Spirometry that met ATS criteria was
included in the data analysis. Spirometry was collected from 102 cooks; 70 were dropped because
they failed to meet American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria, leaving 32 cooks (26 primary, 6
secondary; all but 1 female). Some of the challenges with obtaining spirometry data that satisfied
the ATS criteria include: 1) cooks had difficulty taking multiple deep breaths with their mouth
around the mouthpiece (perhaps using a smaller-diameter mouthpiece would address this problem
in the future); 2) nervousness performing the test in front of others; 3) custom of wearing nose
rings, which made it challenging to prevent air from escaping through nasal passages during
exhalation. Blood pressure was collected from 113 cooks (95 primary, 18 secondary); self-
S-5
reported time spent in the hospital due to ARI was collected from each household (n=105) and
114 cooks answered the questions about incidence of cold/cough.

members spent in the hospital for the last episode of ARI. All analyses also control for age, BMI and gender except hospital days (because it was measured at the
household not individual level). BP, spirometry, and days in hospital were analyzed using OLS models with robust standard errors (R¬2 reported). Incidence of
cold/cough was modeled with logit (pseudo-R2 reported).
Results for PM2.5 were negatively associated with hypertension in univariate models (controlling for age, BMI, gender); multivariate models underspecified due
to limited incidence of hypertension. Normal FEV1 was not modeled because all middle aged cooks have normal FEV1.
9 Multivariate regressions were underspecified due to limited small sample size

Abstract
The present study is to evaluate the quality of Ambient Air in the Balgopalpur industrial estate. Ambient Air Quality
(AAQ) with respect to SPM, RPM, SO , NO and CO have been monitored in different sensitive area like Kurunia

village and Mukhura village. Monitoring was conducted over a period of one year viz. 2011-2012 seasonally with the
aim of analyzing air pollutants levels. Maximum, minimum, mean and Standard Deviation values were calculated for the
monitoring parameters for each station and the results were discussed in the present study. It was revealed that all the

2.4.1 Random forest
AccordingtoBreiman(2001)andBelgiumandDrăguţ(2016),
RF is an effective tree-based algorithm for problems relating to
classification and regression. This algorithm resists overtraining,
outliers in predictors, and handling missing values because all
individual trees are independent, eliminating the possibility of
over fitting (Breiman and Cutler, 2004). RF algorithm uses
decision trees as its foundation; it constructs each tree using a
bootstrap sample of data and divides each point in the tree of
randomlychosenpredictors(LiawandWiener,2002).Utilizingthe
impurity Giniindex,thedecisiontreesintegrate allofthetreesto
makepredictions(Cutleretal.,2007).Apresetsamplesubsetofthe
available data is used by each component tree in a RF algorithm
(ArcherandKimes,2008).Differentbootstrapsamplesarechosen

parameters like SPM, RSPM (PM10), SO2 & NOX are presented in Table 6.1 to 6.3 and trend analysis
of the parameters during the study period are shown in Fig. 6.1 to 6.8. Seasonal variation of SPM &
PM10 are shown in Fig. 6.9-6.25. Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of each location
is shown in Table-6.4.
6.2.1 SO2 & NOX
The annual average value of SO2& NOX at Regional Office, & IDL outpost for the year 2006
to 2014 and at DISIR, Rajgangpur for the year 2013 & 2014 were below their respective limit i.e.,
50 |ig/m3 for SO2 & 40 |ig/m3 for NOX. The annual average value of SO2 was maximum i.e., 6.0
|ig/m3 in the year 2014 at Regional Office, Sector-5 & minimum i.e., 5.0 |ig/m3 in the year 2007.
Maximum annual average of SO2 at IDL outpost was 5.4 ^g/m3 in the year 2008 & minimum 4.9
^g/m3 in the year 2010 & 2014 and maximum annual average of SO2 at DISIR, Rajgangpur was
5.5 |ig/m3 in the year 2014 & minimum 5.2 ^g/m3 in the year 2013.The maximum annual average
value for NOX at Regional Office, was 12.0 |ig/m3 in the year 2014, at IDL outpost was 10.7 ^g/m3 in
the year 2010 & 2011 and at DISIR, Rajgangpur was 12.0 |ig/m3 in the year 2013. NOX at Regional
Office, was in increasing trend from 2007 to 2009 and then it shows decreasing trend. NOX at IDL
outpost was in increasing trend from the year 2007 to 2011 & decreases from 2012 to 2014 and NOX
at DISIR, Rajgangpur increased from 5.2 ^g/m3 in the year 2013 to 5.5 |ig/m3 in 2014. On the basis
of exceedence factor, both SO2 & NOX are fell under Low category at all locations throughout the
study period.
6.2.2 SPM & RSPM (PM10)
The annual average of SPM value in all three locations were above the limit i.e., 140 ^g/m3.
Maximum frequency of violation for SPM on 24 hrly average was 80 % in the year 2010 at Regional
Office was 75 % at IDL outpost in the year 2008 and was 98 % at DISIR, Rajgangpur in the year
2013.

Rajgangpur in the year 2014. The trend of RSPM at Regional Office, increased from the year 2006
to 2009 and decreases from the year 2010 to 2014. The trend at IDL outpost was mostly decreasing.
Trend at DISIR, Rajgangpur increased from the year 2013 to 2014. The exceedence factor showed
Critical at Regional Office, & IDL outpost from the year 2006 to 2013 & High in 2014 at both
locations and DISIR, Rajgangpur showed Critical in both the year 2013 & 2014.
From seasonal variation it was observed that SPM & RSPM (PM10) showed high value during winter
and low value during monsoon in most of the years at all locations. However maximum value of
SPM was observed i.e., 208 |ig/m3 in 2007-08 at IDL outpost 239 |ig/m3 in 2012-13 at Regional
Office, during post monsoon season and 225 |ig/m3 in the year 2011-12. Similarly maximum
seasonal value of RSPM (PM10) was 117 ^g/m3 in the year 2010-11 at Regional Office, 111 ^g/m3 at

of parameters like SPM, RSPM (PM10), SO2 & NOX are presented in Table 7.2 and trend of the
parameters are shown in Fig. 7.1 to 7.4 Seasonal variation of SPM & PM10 are shown in Fig. 7.5 to
7.22.Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of the area was shown in Table-7.2
7.2.1 SO2 & NOX
The annual average value of SO2 & NOX at Modipada for the year 2006 to 2014 were below
their respective limits i.e., 50 |ig/m3 for SO2 & 40 |ig/m3 for NOX. NOX was in increasing trend
from the year 2006 to 2009, then decreased upto the year 2011 and again increased thereafter. The
exceedence factor of SO2 & NOX showed Low throughout the study period. The maximum annual
average value of NOX was 16 ^g/m3 observed in the year 2009.
7.2.2 SPM & RSPM (PM10)
The annual average of SPM value was below the limit i.e., 140 ^g/m3 during the study
period and maximum annual average as shown in the year 2009 was 136 ^g/m3. The trend of SPM
was in increasing trend from the year 2006 to 2009 and decreased slowly thereafter. The exceedence
factor of SPM showed moderate throughout the study period.
The annual average of RSPM (PM10) was below the limit i.e., 60 ^g/m3 from the year 2006
to 2014 and maximum annual average as shown in the year 2014 i.e., 55 ^g/m3. The trend of RSPM
(PM10) at Modipada was in increasing trend at the beginning of the year from 2006 to 2009.
The trend then decreased from the year 2009 onwards. The exceedence factor of RSPM showed
Moderate throughout the study period.
From seasonal variation it was observed that SPM & RSPM (PM10) during winter season
showed maximum and during monsoon showed minimum value during the study period. However,
maximum seasonal average of SPM was 141 ^g/m3 in the year 2013-14 during summer, 156 ^g/m3
during post-monsoon and RSPM showed maximum 368 ^g/m3 in 2014 during post-monsoon, 57

11.2 AMBIENT AIR QUALITY OF KALINGANAGAR
Ambient air quality status of Kalinganagar area at two locations i.e., Roof of NINL Guest
House and on the roof of TATA Steel office in the year 2013 & 2014 with respect to annual average
value, range value of 24 hourly average and frequency of violation of parameters like SPM, RSPM
(PM10), SO2 & NOX are presented in Table 11.1 & 11.2.Seasonal variation of SPM & RSPM are
shown in Fig. 11.1 to 11.4. Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of the locations were
shown in Table 11.3.
11.2.1 SO2 & NOX
The annual average value of SO2 & NOX at both the locations remained below their respective
limits i.e., 50 |ig/m3 for SO2 & 40 |ig/m3 for NOX. The maximum annual average value of NOX was
16.9 ^g/m3 on the roof of NINL Guest House & 16.0 ^g/m3 on the roof of TATA steel office in the
year 2013. On the basis of exceedence factor, SO2 & NOX fell under Low category at all locations
throughout the study period.
11.2.2 SPM & RSPM (PM10)
The annual average value of SPM at both locations were well within the prescribed limit
i.e., 360 |ig/m3 for industrial area as well as within the 24 hrly limit. There were no frequency of
violation observed for SPM in industrial area on 24 hourly average basis at both locations.The
maximum annual average value was 218 ^g/m3 at NINL guest house and was 219 ^g/m3 at TATA
Steel office in the year 2014. The exceedence factor at both the locations remained under High
category in the year 2013 & Moderate in the year 2014.

Ambient Air Quality Status and Trends in Odisha
A. CONCLUSION
1. SO2
At all the monitored locations of the State for the year 2006 to 2014 the SO2 concentration
were Below Detectable limit (BDL) i.e.,<4.0 ^g/m3 except in few areas like Angul, Talcher, Rourkela
and Rasulpur of Balasore where SO2 remains above BDL. However, the values were well below the
prescribed limit i.e., 50 |ig/m3. In these areas the source of SO2 was from industrial emission. The
maximum annual average of SO2 was observed at MCL, Talcher as 14.3 |ig/m3 in the year 2008. All
places fell under Low category in the State on the basis of exceedence factor.
2. NOx
Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) of all monitored stations of Odisha during the year 2006-2014
remained in the Low Category except sometimes under Moderate Category at Angul, Talcher,
Rayagada and Badambadi area of Cuttack. The Maximum annual average of NOX value was 43 |ig/
m3 as observed at Badambadi traffic tower in the year 2007. The NOX values of all stations remained
well within the prescribed limit i.e., 40 |ig/m3. High NOx at Badambadi area might be due to traffic
junction near the monitoring station. From the trend of analysis (from the year 2006 to 2014) it
was observed that the trend was increasing at all the monitoring stations except one at Traffic tower,
Badambadi which was in decreasing trend and remained unchanged at RO, Baniapat,Keonjhar
3. SPM
SPM value at all monitoring locations of the State from the year 2006 to 2014 showed that
in industrial area the annual average value was below the prescribed limit i.e., 360 ^g/m3 and the
trend was decreasing. However, at Talcher thermal power station, Talcher, it was in increasing
trend. Industrial areas like RO, SPCB, Angul and TTPS, Talcher fell under Moderate category
where as at Jaykaypur, Indian farmers fertilizer corporation, Paradeep & at Nilachal Ispat Nigam
Ltd, Kalinga Nagar, fell under Low category. In residential area, the annual average value of SPM
was above the prescribed limit i.e., 140 ^g/m3 at all locations except at Sambalpur & Rayagada.
The trend at all residential locations were increasing except at Rayagada which was in decreasing
trend. On the basis of categorisation, all locations fell in Moderate to High Categories and at some
places it became Critical. The High SPM value in major towns were mainly due to road dust and
construction of roads & buildings as well as from domestic sources.
4. PM10
PM10 Values in both industrial and residential area at all locations from the year 2006 to
2013 indicates that the annual average values at all the locations were higher than the prescribed
limit i.e., 60 ^g/m3 except at few locations like Paradeep, Sambalpur, Rayagada & Town Police
Station, Puri where it remained below the limit. The High PM10 values in the major towns indicated
140
Ambient Air Quality Status and Trends in Odisha
that vehicular emission was the root cause which contributed very fine particles of size less than
10^ to the ambient air. From the trend analysis it was observed that at all locations the trend were
in increasing order except at Keonjhar, Sambalpur & Rourkela where the trend were in decreasing
order. All monitoring locations fall under High and Critical categories except Moderate Category
at Rayagada, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Paradeep areas. The fine dust in major towns came from
vehicular emission due to steep increase in number of vehicles in the town area in addition to
construction work and cutting of trees due to expansion ofroad and domehtic emission contributed
towards PM10.
Trend in percentage of locations with low, moderate, high and critical level of PM10 is depicted in
Fig. A PM10 level showed an increasing trend in Critical category indicating increase in pollution
level during lust 9 yerrs.

5. PM2.5
PM25 sample was monitored at Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri in the year 2014. The
annual average value of PM2 5 at all monitoring location of Cuttack exceeded the limit i.e 40 ^g/m3.
Where as in Bhubaneswar and Puri all monitoring stations were within the limit except at Capital
Police Station, Bhubaneswar i.e, 44 ^g/m3. The maximum 24 hrly. average value of PM25 was
observed on the day of Deepawali i.e, 504 ^g/m3atat SPCB office Building Bhubaneswar. Besides
that 6.4to13.5%ofviolation to24Hourly standardwasabservedat Bhubaneswar, 22.5to35.6% of
violation observed at Cuttack and 15% of violation was observed at Puri.

B. RECOMMENDATION
It is revealed from this compilation that Particulate matter both SPM and RSPM are the
major constituents for downgrading the Ambient Air Quality. More over non-compliance to
Ambient Air Quality Status with respect to RSPM is a major concern. In urban areas the RSPM are
mostly generating from the vehicular emission, road dust, domestic fuel like wood, coal, kerosene
etc. Hence the following recommendations are proposed to mitigate this problem.
1. Improvement of road conditions, effective traffic planning and management particularly
at the traffic intersections, construction of more fly overs and subways and closing of
T-Junctions for better traffic flow.
2. Making the city more accessible for cyclist and pedestrians is the most effective way of
incentivising walking and cycling and discouraging car use.
3. More than 15 year old commercial vehicles should be phased out from the road, regular
check of vehicles with regards to pollution norms, mass transportation system like public
bus, train, trams where ever possible shall be encouraged.
4. Adulteration of automobile fuel and lubricants should be regulated by surprise checks.
5. Mass awareness regarding vehicular pollution control, messages/articles related to vehicular
emission should be created through newsletters, pamphlets, magazines, television and radio
for public awareness.
6. Open burning of dry leaves, tyres, wastes paper, plastic and other garbage etc. should be
prohibited. Mass awareness should be created to use waste, dry leaves etc. for composting.
7. Promote the use of LPG/Bio gas for the Domestic purposes.
8. The blanket of green vegetation on dry non-vegetated areas effectively act as protection
against wind borne particulate generated from the roads. So the green coverage in the cities
and town should be encouraged.
9. Dust and emission control measure during construction and demolition of buildings &
roads.
(i) Putting up solid barriers around the construction to limit the effect of dust at site.
(ii) Using water sprays or sprinklers to keep the dust down during construction activities.
(iii) Properly covering lorries that carries the construction material and waste.
10. Cleaning of road dust at frequent intervals particularly in the city area will reduce the
menace of dust pollution

FOREWORD
The State Pollution Control Board, Odisha has been monitoring the Ambient
Air Quality at 32 locations in 13 towns/cities, viz., Angul-Talcher, Balasore,
Berhampur, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Kalinganagar, Keonjhar, Konark, Paradeep, Puri,
Rayagada, Rourkela and Sambalpur under the National Air Quality Monitoring
Programme (NAMP) and State Air Quality Monitoring Programme (SAMP). This
report describes the summary of the findings over the period 2006-2014 on the
trend of the air quality, seasonal variation, non-attainment areas, etc. The monitoring
results indicate that at all the places concentration of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and
Oxide of Nitrogen (NOX) in the ambient air remained much below the prescribed
standards. However, in majority of the towns, the levels of Respirable Suspended
Particulate Matter (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are the main
problems responsible for downgrading the Ambient Air Quality. Certain actions to
mitigate this problem have been recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Ambient air quality in terms of the concentration of air pollutants present is not only de­
pend on the quantities of pollutants emitted from air polluting sources but also on the ability of the
atmosphere to either absorb or disperse these emission. The concentration of pollutants varies
spatially and temporarily due to changes in meteorological and topographical condition. The
presence of air pollutants above the prescribed limit in the ambient air adversely affects the
environment including health of the human being. In order to prevent and control air
pollution, the Union Govt. enacted the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act in 1981. The
responsibility has been further emphasized under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which
necessitate to address the pollution problem through air quality survey/monitoring programs.
The Central Pollution Control Board has taken up a programme under the National Ambient Air
Quality Monitoring programme during 1984 - 85 at national level, to assess the Ambient air quality
status of the country in the important towns and cities.
The ambient air quality monitoring network involves measurement of a number of air pol­
lutants at different locations in the country. Air quality monitoring requires proper selection of
pollutants, selection of locations, frequency and duration of sampling, sampling techniques, infra­
structural facilities, man power and operation & maintenance. The locations selected for monitor­
ing are based on high traffic density, industrial growth, human population and its distribution,
emission source, public complaints, the land use pattern etc. The quality of the air that we breathe
affects our health and quality of life. It can also have major impacts on the ecosystem. Measuring
and understanding air pollution provides a sound scientific basis for its management and control.
Historically, air pollution problem has typically been high levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide
arising from the combustion of sulphur-containing fossil fuels such as coal for domestic and indus­
trial purpose. However, now the major threat to clean urban air is posed by vehicular emission. A
variety of pollutants are emitted by petrol and diesel driven-engine motor vehicles. These include
carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and par­
ticulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5). The sources of particulate matters are mostly from biomass
incineration, combustion of fuel, re-suspension of traffic dust, process emission etc. Fine particles
contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are very small and they can penetrate deep into
the lungs and cause serious health problems. Generally, coarse particles are directly emitted and
fine particles can be formed in the atmosphere. Photochemical reactions resulting from the action
of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and VOCs from vehicles leads to the formation of ozone.
Ozone is a secondary long-range pollutant, which affects areas far from the original emission site.
1.1 Composition of Natural Dry Air
Atmosphere is the protective blanket of gases, surrounding the earth, which sustains life on
the earth. Pure air is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21.0% oxygen, 0.03% carbon dioxide, 0.93%
inert gases, traces of hydrogen and variable amount of water vapour. Composition of pure air is
presented in Fig. 1.0 & Table-1.0

1.2 Sources of Air Pollution
1.2.1 Natural Sources
Pollution of the air from the natural sources
include volcanic eruptions, naturally occurring forest
fires, dust stirred up by storm winds, gases produced by
decay, dust from erosion and airborne pollen. About
57% of the SO2 is produced globally from hydrogen
sulphide gas from natural resources. About 7.2% of the
carbon monoxide and 5.8% of nitrogen oxide emission
is contributed by the forest fires. Natural sources of
hydrocarbon include bacterial decomposition of organic
matter which produces large amount of methane. Man Plate 1: Forest Fire
made emission accounts for only 6% of the total atmosphere content of hydrocarbons. Plate 1
shows a natural source of air pollution due to forest fire.
1.2.2 Anthropogenic Sources
Air pollution from human activity is probably as old as our ability to start fire. But large
scale air pollution from industry is a relatively recent development. Furthermore, the resulting
contaminants are likely to be emitted to the air in regions where many people live. Man-made
sources of pollutants can be classified as stationary combustion sources, mobile combustion sources
and manufacturing sources.
(i) Stationary Combustion Sources
The principal emission from stationary combustion
processes that use coal or petroleum are particulate matters like
fly ash, smoke and gaseous substances like oxides of sulphur and
nitrogen. Sulphur oxide emission is a function of the amount of
sulphur present in that fuel. Incomplete combustion of carbons
and hydrocarbons produce carbon monoxide and soot particles
that consist mostly of carbon.
Another important source of air pollutant in developing
countries is the burning of biomass fuel and coal for domestic
cooking and room heating at high altitudes. Wood, crop residues,
animal dung and other forms of biomass and coal are used by
approximately half the world’s population as cooking and/or
heating fuels. Emission from biomass fuel combustion contains
carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde and particulate matter of
Plate 3: Woman exposed to Indoor

various sizes. Cooking with bio-fuels contributes about 23% of global pollution, affecting mostly
women and children (UNEP, 1999). About 200 million women in developing countries are exposed
to conditions similar to smoking 2 - 20 packs of cigarettes per day. Plate 2 shows the pollution due
to cooking.
(ii) Combustion of Automobile Fuels
While most of the light vehicles like two & three
wheelers and cars are petrol fuelled; but the heavier vehicles
used for mass transportation are diesel fuelled. Automobile
exhausts from petrol and diesel engines vary with respect to
the type and concentration of the pollutants. The principal
pollutants emitted by petrol-fuelled vehicles are carbon
monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, while those
from diesel vehicles are particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and sulphur dioxide. Plate 4 shows the
Plate 4: Emission from Automobile
pollution due to auto mobile exhaust.
Exhaust
(iii) Manufacturing Sources
Thousands of materials are manufactured regularly for
use in industry, commerce and households. In the process,
unwanted particulate matters and / or gases are generated and
released into the atmosphere.
Plate 5 shows the pollution due to industrial activity.
Plate 5: Industrial Emission
1.3 Effect of Air Pollutants
Air pollutants above certain concentrations have adverse effect on health, vegetation as well
as on animals. Major sources of air pollutants and its Impact are briefly described in Table 1.1

1.4 B ehaviour of Air Pollutants
Concentration of ai r p ollutants in the ambient air not only
depends on the quality nf pollutants released to the atmosphere b ut
also on meteorological cynditionh topography and physiography
of the area. Meteorologic al condition like inversion, stabil ity class
may build up) the c oncent ration of ppllutants where as windy,
rainy condition may wash out or disperse the pollutants. Valley
wind effect is due to topography of the area.
Plate 6: Relative Size of Particulate Matter
The behaviour op the part icles m ostly depe ndoon the size of th e particulate matter. Large size
particlee with a diameter above 50 mic rons (|) (1|u=10-6 meter) are collectively visiblo in the ai r and
settle down quickly, so that they are not a long term pollution hazard. Particles of size ranges from
50 -0.011 di ameter are of most significant air pollueants. Plate 6 shows relative size of Particulate
Matter. They can remain in the atmosphere for varying lengths of time and undergo chemical
reactions to produce eecondary pollutants. Particles leaving a diameter of below 10| act as nuclei
for the formation of condynsed wnter droplets in cloud formation. Particles can remain suspended
in the dtmosphere for days, weeks, months or years, for example, in the lower troposphere for 6 -
14 days; in upper troposphere nor 2 -4 weeks; in the lower stratosphere upto 6
months and m the upper strat oophere 1-3 years.
According to the behavior ond concent ration of the pollutants, the atmosphere can be
broadly dividod int o 4 leyers . from grpund level to 100 m. the air is much polluted particularly in
the urban preas. Some of thd pollutants are absorbed by vegetation,buildingsandwatersurfaces. It
has been estimated that 33% ofthe SO2 in this layer is removed by absorption.The nextlayer extends
from 1.00m upto the cloud base at a height between 500m and 2000m altitude in the troposphere.
Here the pollutants are well mixed by the turbulent air currents and are washed out by drizzle,

rain and fog. The third layer contains most of the atmospheric water vapour and extends upto the
tropopause. Some pollutants may be dissolved or become nuclei in the cloud water droplets. Later,
they may either be removed from the layers as rain or released again into the atmosphere when
clouds evaporate. Small sized particles remain suspended in the air and undergo photochemical
changes under the action of ultra violet energy. There is also movement of particles by air currents,
upward into the lower stratosphere and horizontally over varying distances, depending on climatic
conditions. There are well known examples of dust and SO2 transference between Europe and
Africa and Scandinavia. The last atmospheric layer stratosphere is having very less concentration
of pollutants. Though the photochemical reactions occur in the stratosphere, there is very little
movement of the pollutants and they remain in the layers for a very long period.
1.5 The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
Government of India enacted the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act in 1981
to address the air pollution problem of the country. The Act prescribes various functions for the
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at the Central level and State Pollution Control Boards
at the State level. The main functions of the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution
Control Board are as follows:
1.5.1 Main functions of the Central Pollution Control Board
• To advise the Central Government on any matter concerning the improvement of the quality
of the air and the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution.
• To plan and execute a nation-wide programme for the prevention, control and abatement of
air pollution.
• To provide technical assistance and guidance to the State Pollution Control Boards.
• To carry out and sponsor investigations and research related to prevention, control and
abatement of air pollution.
• To collect, compile and publish technical and statistical data related to air pollution; and
• To lay down standards for the quality of air.
1.5.2 Main functions of the State Pollution Control Boards
• To plan a comprehensive programme for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution
and to secure the execution thereof.
Ambient Air Quality Status and Trends in Odisha
•viisr
• To advise the State Government on any matter concerning prevention, control and abatement
of air pollution.
• To collect and disseminate information related to air pollution.
• To collaborate with Central Pollution Control Board in programme related to prevention,
control and abatement of air pollution; and
• To inspect air pollution control areas, assess quality of air and to take steps for prevention,
control and abatement of air pollution in such areas.
1.6 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
The ambient air quality objectives/standards are pre-requisite for developing programme
for effective management of ambient air quality and to reduce the damaging effects of air pollution.
With the following objectives the ambient air quality standards are prescribed:
• To indicate the levels of air quality necessary with an adequate margin of safety to protect the
public health, vegetation and property;
• To assist in establishing priorities for abatement and control of pollutant Level;
• To provide uniform yardstick for assessing air quality at national level ; and
• To indicate the need and extent of monitoring programme.
After enactment of Air (PCP) Act 1981, the Central Pollution Control Board had adopted
first Ambient Air Quality Standards on November 11, 1982. Subsequently it was revised during
1994, 1998 and recently on November, 2009. The ambient air quality standards notified during
1998 and 2009 is given in Table 1.2 and Table 1.3 respectively.

into foue broad categories, besed on exceedence aactor taking in ti account the 1998 and 2009
standards.
Observed annual mean concentration of a criterion pollutant
Exceedence Factor = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annual standard for the respective pollutant and area class
The four air quality categories are:
Critical pollution (C) : when EF is more than 1.5;
High pollution (H) : when the EF is L0 to 1 .5;
Moderate pollution(M) : whentheE F is 0.5tol.0; and
Love pollution (L) : where the EF is less than 0 .5

3.2 Ambient Air Quality of Cuttack City
Ambient Air Quality status of Cuttack city from the year 2006 to 2014 with respect to
annual average value, range value of 24 hrly average and frequency of violation of parameters like
SPM, RSPM (PM10), SO2 & NOx at SPCB, Building, Surya vihar, Traffic Tower, Badambadi and at
PHD office Barabati for the year 2013 & 2014 are presented in Table 3.1 to 3.3 and trend of the
parameters are shown in Fig. 3.1 to 3.8. Seasonal variation of SPM & PM10 are shown in Fig. 3.9­
3.26. Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of each location shown in Table 3.4.
3.2.1 SO. & NO
2 x
The annual average value of SO2 & NOX at all locations were below their respective limits
i.e., 50 ^g/m3 for SO2 & 40 |^g/m3 for NOx except NOx at Traffic Tower, Badambadi in 2006 &
2007. The trend of SO2 at three locations remained unchanged. The maximum annual average for
NOX at RO, Building, Surya vihar was 26.5 ^g/m3 in the year 2014; Traffic tower, Badambadi was
53.6 ^g/m3 in the year 2006 & at PHD office, Barabati was 30.8 ^g/m3 in the year 2014. The trend
of NOX at all three locations decreases from the year 2006 to 2013. SO2 falls under Low category at
all three locations where as NOX falls under Low category at most of the time at all locations, except
High in the year 2006 & 2007, Moderate in the year 2010,2011 & 2014 at Traffic tower Badambadi,
High in the year 2006 and Moderate in the year 2014 at RO, Building, Surya vihar and Moderate in
the year 2014 at PHD office Barabati.

4.2 Ambient Air Quality of Angul & Talcher Area
Ambient Air Quality status of Angul & Talcher area from the year 2006-2014 with respect
to annual average value, range value of 24 hrly average and frequency of violation of parameters
like SPM, RSPM (PM10),SO2 & NOx are presented in Table 4.1 to 4.4 and trend of the parameters
are shown in Fig. 4.1 to 4.16.Seasonal variation of SPM & PM10 are shown in Fig. 4.17 to 4.32.
Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of the area is shown in Table 4.5
4.2.1 SO. & NO
2 x
The annual average value of SO2 & NOX at all locations are below their respective limits 50
|ig/m3 for SO2 & 40 |ig/m3 for NOX. Maximum annual average value of NOX at Angul, Industrial
Estate was 23.3 |ig/m3, at NALCO it was 21.8 |ig/m3, at TTPS, Talcher it was 23.5 |ig/m3 in the
year 2014 and was 26.8 |ig/m3 in the year 2009 at MCL, Talcher. The trend of SO2 & NOX at three
locations are mostly in increasing trend. Whereas at Mahanadi coal field location both parameters
showed both fluctuating trend. SO2 falls under Low category at all locations where as NOX shows
mostly Low from the year 2006 to 2009 and Moderate at all location in the year 2013 & 2014.In the
year 2010 to 2012 show Moderate at Industrial Estate, Angul & Low in Nalco township & TTPS,
Talcher.
4.2.2 SPM & RSPM (PM10)
The annual average of SPM value in industrial area i.e., at Angul, Industrial Estate & TTPS,
Talcher are below the limit i.e., 360 |ig/m3 for industrial area throughout the study period. While
SPM at NALCO, and Mahanadi coal field exceeded the limit i.e., 140 ^g/m3 for Residential area
in all years except at NALCO, in the year 2006 & 2007. Maximum annual average value of SPM at
Angul, Industrial Estate was 326 |ig/m3 in the year 2009, at NALCO it was 238 |ig/m3 in the year
2014, at TTPS, Talcher it was 236 |ig/m3 in the year 2011 and was 268 |ig/m3 in the year 2010 at
MCL, Talcher. Maximum frequency of violation for SPM in industrial area on 24hrly average was
19.2 % in the year 2009. For Residential area the maximum percentage of violation was 72.1% at
NALCO township in the year 2014 and 66.3 % at Mahanadi Coal field in the year 2009. SPM at all
locations were in increasing trend except industrial Estate, Angul which was in decreasing trend.
The annual average of RSPM (PM10) at all four locations were above the limit i.e., 60 (j.g/
m3.The maximum annual average of RSPM (PM10) at Industrial Estate, Angul was 158 ^g/m3 in the
year 2009 at Nalco township, Angul it was 115 ^g/m3 in the year 2014, at TTPS it was 114 ^g/ m3 in
the year 2014 and at Mahanadi coal field it was 135 ^g/m3 in the year 2010 & 2014.
From seasonal variation it was observed that during monsoon the concentration of SPM
& RSPM (PM10) showed minimum values in most of the years at all locations. The exceedence
factor for SPM showed Moderate in both the Industrial area i.e., Industrial Estate, Angul & TTPS
Talcher throughout the study period except Low at TTPS, Talcher in the year 2007.While SPM at
residential area i.e., Nalco Township show High for the year 2008 to 2012, showed Moderate in the
year 2006 & 2007 and Critical in the year 2013 & 2014. Whereas at Mahanadi coal field it remains
Moderate for the year 2007 to 2010 & Critical in the year 2013 & 2014 and Low in the year 2006.
Similarly RSPM(PM10) in the Industrial area i.e., Industrial Estate Angul remained Critical
from the year 2010 to 2014 & in the year 2006 & High from the year 2007 to 2009.TTPS, Talcher
remained Critical in the year 2006 & from the year 2010 to 2014, Moderate in the year 2008 & 2009
and High in the year 2007 .In Residential area at Nalco township it showed High from the year 2006
to 2011 & Critical from the year 2012 to 2014.At Mahanadi coal field it showed High in the year

and trend of the parameters are shown in Fig. 5.1 to 5.8. Seasonal variation of SPM & PM10 are
shown in Fig. 5.9 to 5.26. Categorisation on the basis of exceedence factor of each location is shown
in Table 5.3.
5.2.1 SO. & NO
2 x
The annual average value of SO2 & NOx at Regional office Building, Rayagada (Residential
area) & Jaykaypur (Industrial area) for the year 2006 to 2014 are below their respective limits i.e., 50
|ig/m3 for SO2 & 40 |ig/m3 for NOX. The maximum annual average value for NOX at Regional office
Building, Rayagada was 22.4 ^g/m3 & at Jaykaypur it was 22.8 |ig/m3 in the year 2013. NOX at both
the locations are mostly in increasing trend. The exceedence factor of SO2 at both the locations were
under Low category while NOX at Regional Office Building, Rayagada was under Low category
from the year 2006 to 2010 & 2014 and Moderate from the year 2011 to 2013 and Jaykaypur was
under Low category from the year 2006 to 2009 and Moderate from 2010 to 2014.
5.2.2 SPM & RSPM (PM10)
The annual average of SPM value at Regional Office Building, Rayagada & Jaykaypur from
the year 2006 to 2014 are below their respective limits i.e., 140 |ig/m3 for residential area and
360 ^g/m3 for industrial area. Maximum annual average value was observed at Regional office
Building, Indiranagar was 121 ^g/m3 & at Jaykapur was 112 ^g/m3 in the year 2008. The trend of
SPM at both locations are mostly in decreasing trend in the study period. The exceedence factor of
SPM shows Moderate category at Regional Office Building, Rayagada from the year 2006 to 2011
& 2014 and Low in the year 2012 & 2013 and at Jaykaypur it was Moderate in 2008 & 2014, Low
in the year 2006 & 07 and 2009 to 2013.
The annual average of RSPM at both the locations were mostly below the limit i.e., 60^g/
m3. However, during 2008 the maximum annual average value was 65 ^g/m3 at Regional Office
Building, Rayagada and at Jaykaypur it was 63 ^g/m3. The trend of RSPM at both locations are
in decreasing trend during study period. The exceedence factor of RSPM was under Moderate
category at Regional Office Building, Rayagada from the year 2006 to 2007 2009 to 2014 and High
in the year 2008 and at Jaykaypur it was under Moderate category from 2006 to 2009 & 2011 to
2014 and High in the year 2010.

AbstrAct
Background: Around 3 billion people use solid fuels (biomass and coal) for cooking and heating, and this number is expected to
grow until at least 2030. Around 73.7% of households in rural Odisha use wood for cooking. This current study is an attempt to
evaluate the impact of solid cooking fuels on health of rural women in age group of 20–40 years and to study the relationship
between the duration of exposure to cooking fuels and various health problems. Materials and Methods: This cross‑sectional
study was carried out in a village which is under the field practice area of the rural health and training centre, under Department
of Community Medicine, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences. Universal sampling technique was adopted for sample selection.
Chi‑square test was used to find the association between cooking fuel usage and self‑reported symptoms. Results: Dry cough was
the most common presenting symptom (15.03%), followed by eye and nose irritation present in nearly 12% each among the study
participants. Headache, dry cough, and hypertension (HT) was found to associated with number of cooking years and was also found
to be statistically significant (P = 0.03, 0.02 and 0.0065, respectively). Discussion: Our study clearly indicated that the exposure to
biomass fuel smoke is significantly associated with the prevalence of symptoms of headache, dry cough, and HT. Further research
is required for improving information on dose‑response relationships between indoor air pollution and various health effects.
Conclusion: The morbidities were increased with increase in duration of cooking . Knowledge related to health effects of cooking
fuels seems to be poor among the participants.

Aerosol retrieval of great importance, e.g. for air-quality monitoring. However, limited by coarse spatial resolution, available

this issue, a new high-resolution (60 m) aerosol retrieval algorithm based on Sentinel-2 data over urban areas
High resolution was developed. To improve the estimation of surface reflectance, two algorithms: (1) the new visible/2.19 μm
surface reflectance relationships as a function of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for vegetated
areas; and (2) the surface reflectance database preconstructed from the operational high-quality and high-
resolution Landsat 8 surface reflectance products for bright areas, were adopted depending on the surface
types. For validation, the derived retrievals from Sentinel-2, along with the operational MODerate resolution
Imaging Spectrometer Collection 6 (C6) aerosol products (MOD04_L2 and MCD19A2), were compared with
measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations. The validation results show that the Sentinel-
2 AOD retrievals agreed well with the AERONET AOD measurements, with an overall correlation coefficient of
0.907, expected error (EE) of 73.76%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.087, and root mean square error (RMSE)
of 0.117. Comparison of the results with MOD04_L2 products (10 km) show that the Sentinel-2 AODs were
superior in the situations considered, indicating that the new algorithm performed better in AOD retrieval over
urban areas. Compared with the fine spatial resolution MCD19A2 products (1 km), retrievals of the proposed
algorithm were comparable. The new algorithm is able to retrieve high-resolution AODs reasonably well from
Sentinel-2 images over urban areas, and can provide continuous and detailed aerosol spatial distributions. Owing
to the ability of the Sentinel-2 satellite to provide observations at 5-day intervals, the proposed algorithm is
capable of monitoring aerosol distributions at relatively fine temporal resolution.

contemporaries, such as MODIS, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM),
Landsat ETM+, and Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 is superior for characterizing
high spatial resolution and relatively high temporal resolution simul-
taneously, leading to the possibility of retrieving aerosol properties at
high spatial resolution and fine temporal resolution. However, because
of the differences in spectral response functions and spectral channels
among different sensors, the algorithms described above cannot be
directly applied to Sentinel-2 images. Thus, further development of new
algorithms for Sentinel-2 aerosol retrieval over urban areas is critically
needed.
In this paper, we developed a new approach to retrieve 60 m spatial
resolution AODs from Sentinel-2 images over urban areas. To improve
the estimation of surface reflectance, two algorithms for the vegetated
areas and the bright areas were employed respectively: (1) the new VIS/
2.19 μm surface reflectance relationships as a function of
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and (2) the surface
reflectance database preconstructed from the operational high-quality
and high-resolution Landsat 8 surface reflectance products. Then
Sentinel-2 images covering the period 2018–2019 were collected to
perform aerosol retrieval experiments using this new algorithm. The
Sentinel-2 retrieved AODs were validated against the Aerosol Robotic
Network (AERONET) measurements and compared with MODIS stan-

ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades there has been growing importance of sustainable development principles within
the mining sector. Coal mining is the foundation of India as well as Odisha’s economic development. It
provides energy safety. However, continued production of minerals and fossil energy fuels may not fit into
sustainability principle. A number of coal mining companies, all over the world, have embraced
sustainability as a prime aspect of corporate philosophy. The increasing need of sustainable mining has been
realised especially in the light of environmental externalities and global warming. It is in this context, the
research problem has been built. Mahanadi coal fields limited (MCL) which was carved out of south eastern
coal field limited (SECL) was formed on 3rd April 1992 with its head quarters at Sambalpur, Odisha. The
coal reserve of MCL is spread over its two coal fields viz Talcher and and IB River valley with ten operating
areas consisting six underground and sixteen open cast projects under its fold. To what extent MCL seems
to take care of the environmental externalities? Does it adopt the sustainable mining operations? These are
some of the queries which the paper attempts to ponder.
The study is based on secondary data which is mostly collected from websites, annual reports and
sustainability reports of MCL. A number of documents and literature are to be accessed through internets.
This paper is organised into varied sections. Followed by this introduction, the second and third section are
on review of literature, concepts and meaning of sustainable coal mining operation. Section four describes
about profile of MCL. Section five and six analyse the data. The sustainable coal mining is delineated in the
subsequent section. The paper ends with brief concluding remarks.
Keywords: Sustainable Development, Coal Mining, Sustainability, Environmental pollution
1. INTRODUCTION
The concept of sustainable development within the mining sector has accepted over past two decades. This
concept in coal mining is now not new, has become active in sustainability effort. Now various global coal
mining companies belief sustainability as key aspect of corporate philosophy. Coal plays an important role
in sustainable future as the most widely used energy source in electricity generation and steel production
globally. Coal mining in India is also play an important role in electricity generation. It contributes about
82% of electricity generation and was top third coal producer in the world. Coal mining provides raw
materials for industrial development and creates job opportunities for local people. Further, it has spill-over
benefits like schooling, hospitals, and transport and communication facilities in the mining areas. However
the rising demand would result in increased coal mining and consequently the concern over the ecological
degradation, biodiversity losses, air, water, noise pollution and adverse activities on agricultural production
(Mishra and Pujari 2008). Coal mining creates employment, generates value, and improves the foreign
investment of a country or region. However, it has its disadvantages including negative externalities. The
coal mining activities in area like uncovered coal transportation, lack of water spraying system and
movement of heavy vehicles, brought to air pollution to the locality suspended particulate matter
concentration is alarmingly high in local area. The extraction of mining has influenced the water table
(Mishra and Das, 2017). Health externalities of social cost of coal has increasing it causes respiratory health
problem. Health externality effects of coal power plants in India (Guptaa and Spearsb, 2017). Health
problem due to coal mining are fevers, gastritis, skin diseases, joint pain and, also cases of weakness, cough
and cold, asthma and gynaecological problems. Due coal mining activities it causes water pollution, water
pond are filled coal dust, also causes air pollution with coal loaded trucks (Mishra, 2009).

The sustainable development presents a considerable challenge to the coal mining in India. To meet the
increased demand of coal, it threats to the environment. In this context, the research problem has been built.
Sustainable development of coal mining in Odisha is one of the Indian state is also a challenge because it
causes air, water, noise pollution, ecological degradation, biodiversity loss and also it causes damage to
human health. Therefore present study analyse the economic and environmental sustainability of coal
mining in Odisha. To what extent coal mining companies (public and private) seems to take care of the
environmental externalities? Does they adopt the sustainable mining operations? These are some of the
queries which the paper attempts to ponder.
1.1 REVIEW OF LITERATURE
The sustainable development concept in coal mining is now not new, has become active in sustainability
effort. Now various global coal mining companies belief sustainability as key aspect of corporate
philosophy. The literature reviewed here are showed how coal mining impact on economy, society and
environment.
Coal mining creates employment, generates value, and improves the foreign investment of a country or
region. However, it has its disadvantages including negative externalities. The coal mining activities like
uncovered coal transportation, lack of water spraying system and movement of heavy vehicles, brought to air
pollution to the locality suspended particulate matter concentration is alarmingly high in few sampling
locations. The extraction of mining has influenced the water table (Mishra and Das, 2017). Health
externalities of social cost of coal has increasing it causes respiratory health problem. Health externality
effects of coal power plants in India (Guptaa and Spearsb, 2017). Health problem due to coal mining are
fevers, gastritis, skin diseases, joint pain and, also cases of weakness, cough and cold, asthma and
gynaecological problems. Due coal mining activities it causes water pollution, water pond are filled coal
dust, also causes air pollution with coal loaded trucks (Mishra, 2009). It has been observed that coal mining
impact on the economy, society and environment in local areas. Although mining activities bring about
economic development in the area, it also causes land degradation that creates ecological and socio-
economic problems (Goswami, 2015).
In most of the developing countries energy requirements are met from coal-based thermal power plants. The
disposal of solid waste from coal-based thermal power plants is causing environmental degradation. In
developed countries like Germany, 80% of the fly ash generated is being utilized, whereas in India only 3%
is being consumed (Senapati, 2011). To overcome from environmental problem proper management is
required by Govt (Goswami, 2015). The policy-maker needs to consider measures to reduce the level of coal
exploitation to save the environment. To reduce coal based thermal plant pollution government should
impose tax and benefits must be transfer to local people (Fatah, 2008). Fly ash becomes an important raw
material for various industrial and construction applications. Fly ash is widely used in construction of bricks,
cement, asbestos-cement products, and road/embankments. Fly ash is being studied for improvement of
agricultural crops, wetlands and zealites. Fly ash has found application in domestic and wastewater treatment
and purification and paint and enamel manufacturing (Dhadse, Kumari and Bhagia, 2008). So, the disposable
management of fly ash from thermal power plant is necessary to protect our environment (Avirneni and
Bandlamudi, 2013). Coal based thermal plants produced waste fly-ash or coal ash which cause
environmental pollution (Haque, 2013).
The coal mining improves economic condition of adjacent community, and they displaced from their land, it
also causes environmental degradation. For sustainable development coal mining care should be taken to
minimise environmental damage.

2) To investigate the induced pollution and sustainable development of coal mining in Odisha.
1.3 METHODOLOGY
The study is based on secondary data collected from Indian Bureau Of mines, government of India,
Directorate of Mines, government of Odisha, Ministry of coal, government of India, Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change, GOI, Annual reports of CIL, MCL, Economic survey of Odisha
and state environment report of Odisha. The data are analysed through SPSS, descriptive statistics, simple
linear regression and Compound Annual Growth rate (CAGR) are used to analyse the data.
In this paper, simple linear regression model is used to analyse the relationship between fly ash utilisation
and fly ash generation.
The simple regression model is
Y = β + β X + U

The paper divided in to three sections, first section deals with introduction, review of literature, objective of
the study and methodology. The section-II explain sustainable coal mining concept. The third section
investigates economic benefit of coal mining in Odisha. Section-IV analyse induced pollution and
sustainable development of coal mining in Odisha and section-v concludes the study.
2. SUSTAINABLE COAL MINING
This section examines the sustainable development (SD) and mining under varied concepts of sustainability.
The World commission on the Environment and Development defined SD as development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs (WCED
1987). The neoclassical growth theory (Hartwick 1977) which incorporated natural resource constraints on
economic activities modelled SD as non declining consumption over time. They were concerned with
intergeneration efficiency rather than equity. Hanley et.al, (1997).
Hartwick proposed non-declining consumption through time as the rule for SD (Hanly etal. 1997). Basing on
the contribution of the London school of Environmental Economics (Khassen & Opschoor 1991, Pearce and
Turner, 1990) formulated the rule focussing on the limited degree of sustainability between natural capital
and human made capital. It is recognised that natural resources have an essential and implacable economic
role to play (Daly 1991). Closely linked to the non declining natural capital stock approach is the safe
minimum standards approach (SMS) of Ciciry-wantrup (1952). The rule is to prevent reductions in the
natural capital stock below a safe minimum standard identified for each component of this stock. Daly
(1990) provides certain operational rules which would be helpful for nations to move on SD path. In case of
renewable resources the rule is to set all harvest levels at less than or equal to the population growth rate for
some predetermined population size. For degradable pollutants, establish assimilative capacities for
ecosystems. In case of non renewable resources like coal mining the depletion should be compensated by
creation of renewable resources through investments in natural capital.
Sustainability is thus fundamentally reconciliation between development and the environmental resources on
which society depends. In other words it is a choice between the weak sustainability (WS) and strong
sustainability. Under the regime of WS natural capital is allowed to be degraded or depleted, but it must be
offset by equal or greater increases in other forms of capital. Strong sustainability requires for separate
maintenance of manmade and natural capital.
As discussed above strong sustainability cannot be applicable in coal mining since it involves extraction of
non renewable resources. But once it leads to non declining long term benefits it can be said as sustainable.
In this paper, attempt has been to trace out whether the benefits from coal mining in terms of job
opportunities for people in local region, revenue recycling an infrastructure base can flow in the long term. Is
it sustainable?

3. ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF COAL MINING IN ODISHA.
The economic benefits from coal mining can be analysed through coal production, value of coal,
employment generation and revenue to the government. There are two major coal bearing areas in the state-
Talcher and Ib valley. Angul (12 mining leases, 9,590 Ha of mining area) is the prime coal mining district
followed by Jharsuguda (14 mining leases, 7,656,55 Ha of mining area), Sambalpur (1 mining lease, 170.305
Ha of mining area) and Sundargarh (1 mining lease occupying 140.84 Ha of mining area. Total reserve of
coal in the 2016-17 is 75895.67 million tonnes. According coal directory, GOI, coal is produced by private
and public companies. Total public coal mines are 26 and 01 private coal mines in 2007-08. From 2007-08 to
2016-17 there is only one private coal mine and public coal mines are varies from 25 to 29. The public coal
mines are controlled by MCL one of the subsidiaries of CIL and private coal mines controlled by HIL (Table
1 and 2).

The economic benefit from coal mining is explained with the help of table 3 and table 4. It shows coal
production in Odisha, value of coal, employment, its growth. Highest coal production was 139.359 million
tonnes in 2016-17. And lowest coal production was 60.14 7 million tonnes in 2003-04. The value of coal was
Rs. 24835.60 million in 2007-08. The highest coal value was Rs. 158984.33 million in 2014-15. The coal
mining in Odisha also provides employment to 12747 nos. of person in 2007-08 and highest employment
was recorded in 2016-17(20800nos. of persons). The percentage of coal share to total coal production of
India has increased from 2003-04 to 2009-10 and again showing an increasing trend form 2013-14 to 2016-
17. And compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of coal production is 17.82.
4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The magnitude and extent of environmental cost caused by coal mining depends on the type of pollutants,
their chemical properties and concentration in the air and water. All the pollutants have damaging effect on
forest and biodiversity, vegetation, human health and cattle health (Berry & Hurton 1974). Several studies
have found that diseases namely asthma, chronic bronchitis, respiratory trouble, blockage of psycho-motor
function, gastro-intestine diseases and so on can be attributed to the air and water pollution caused by coal
mining (OSPCB, 1996; Hota and Behera, 2015). Sources of air pollution in coal mining areas generally
include drilling, blasting, loading and unloading, and exposed pit faces etc. (CMRI, 1998). In the coal mine
area of Angul-Talcher, one of the 22 pollution hotspots in India, the pollution is due to very high intensity of
coal based pollution. The activities like drilling, blasting of coal, dump formation; transport activities reduce

dust and noxious gases which degrades the air quality. The fly ash and pollutants when mixed with water
bodies led to water pollution (GOO, 2008).
Table 5 shows the numbers of coal based power plant, their coal consumption and fly ash generation. The fly
ash generated in 2010-11 was 9.05 million tonnes and highest fly ash generated 14.1534 million tonnes in
2013-14. The fly ash utilisation varies from 3.3419 million tonnes to 6.3975 million tonnes. The fly ash
utilisation was not even 50% except in 2016-17 and 2017-18.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Coal serves as the only natural resources and fossil fuel available in abundance in India and Odisha. Coal
mining provides stream of economic benefits in terms industrialisation, employment and revenue to
government. But at the same time it causes air, water and noise pollution, biodiversity loss, ecological loss
etc. there are various health problems are facing by local people due to coal mining are fevers, gastritis, skin
diseases, joint pain and, also cases of weakness, cough and cold, asthma and gynaecological problems. Fly
ash generation by thermal power plants are causing serious problems. Fly ash utilisation is not satisfactory.
Therefore, careful planning must needed to reduce the environmental damage. Then only sustainable coal
mining is possible.

ABSTRACT
The study of various air pollutants and meteorological parameters are very important for all
the researchers. Baleswar was known to be a seaside districts of odisha which is the economic and
cultural heart of Northern Odisha. The aim of this study is to measure the air pollutants, meteorological
parameters and to enumerate the air pollution index at three specific sites (Sahadevkhunta, Mallikashpur,
Rasalpur) according to CPCB procedures. The air pollutants analysed by supplying through specific
absorbing reagents and the pollutants were analysed up to 3 year (2017, 2018 and 2019) with a
regularity of thrice per week. Analyses of our data sets showing that SO and NO concentration during
2 2
summer, rainy and winter season are within the prescribe standard of NAAQS by CPCB but PM and
10
PM are above the prescribed standard except PM concentration of rainy season in year 2019. Air

pollution index is remaining in the condition between clean air (CA) to moderate air pollution (MAP)
and it shows that the pollution index in all the sites are reducing from the year 2017 to 2019 may be
due to enhancing technologies to reduce the pollutant concentration in air.

1. Background
Hon’ble National Green Tribunal, Delhi, in OA No. 681 dated 08.10.2018, gave the
following directions on non-attainment cities:
All the States and Union Territories with non-attainment cities must
prepare appropriate action plans within two months to bring down the air
pollution levels to the prescribed norms within six months from the date of
finalization of action plans.
Action plans may be prepared by a six-member Committee comprising of
Directors of Environment, Transport, Industries, Urban Development,
Agriculture and Member Secretary, State Pollution Control Board or
Committee of the concerned State. The Committee may be called the Air
Quality Monitoring Committee (AQMC). The Committee will function
under the overall supervision and coordination of the Principal Secretary,
Environment of the concerned State or the Union Territory. This may be
further supervised by the Chief Secretaries concerned or their counterparts
in Union Territories by ensuring intra-sectoral coordination.
The action plan will indicate steps to be taken to check different sources of
pollution, having speedy, definite and specific timelines for execution.
The Chief Secretaries of the State and Administrators / Advisors to
Administrators of the Union Territories will be personally accountable for
the failure to formulate action plans, as directed.
Thereafter, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)
launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) on 10 January 2019 as a time-
bound national-level strategy to reduce air pollution in a comprehensive manner.
The objective has been to reduce particulate pollution by 20-30 per cent from 2017
level by 2024. This has been subsequently tightened with a reduction target of 45
per cent by 2026.
As of today the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified about 134
non-attainment cities/towns based on the ambient air quality (AAQ) data with
respect to particulate matter concentration for the years 2011-2015. Of these,
seven cities belong to the state of Odisha. These include Bhubaneswar, Cuttack,
9
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Rourkela, Balasore, Talcher, Angul and Kalinganagar. All non-attainment cities
have prepared city action plans that have been approved by the CPCB and are under
implementation.
Mandate of State Action Plan
According to the guidance document of the National Clean Air Programme
(NCAP), a State Action Plan is needed to mitigate air pollution. The NCAP policy
document includes an ‘Appendix-VI: NCAP agencies and timelines at S.No.1.13’
that mentions the requirement of State Action Plan for Air Pollution. The MoEFCC
has therefore asked for a State Action Plan to address the air pollution problem at
a larger regional scale.
To enable framing and implementation of the multi-tiered action plans in the
state, the Government of Odisha has constituted the following three committees to
monitor and implement the activities under the NCAP:
i) Steering committee formed as on 01.06.2019
ii) State-level air quality monitoring committee formed as on 15.11.2018
iii) District-level monitoring committee formed as on 16.03.2019 for six cities and
26.03.2021 for Kalinga Nagar
In addition to the state-level committee, city-level air quality management cells
have also been formed to undertake activities in line with the NCAP guidelines.
For the purpose of preparation of the State Action Plan, Odisha State Pollution
Control Board (OSPCB) has carried out consultation with the concerned
departments in different sectors and has incorporated the suggestions,
recommendations and data appropriately for assessment of the status of action and
the roadmap for the sector.
The State Action Plan has taken cognizance of the relevant policies, regulations,
programmes and funding strategies of the state and central governments in the
relevant sectors, current status of actions, and best practice approaches. Several
policies, schemes, programmes as well as the directives, orders and guidelines of
state and central governments have already set the foundation for the abatement of
air pollution in the region.
The multi-sector strategy of the State Action Plan has included within its scope the
mitigation strategies needed in all key sectors of pollution that include industries,
power plants, vehicles and transportation, diesel generator sets, municipal solid
10
waste/biomass burning, construction/demolition waste, road dust and urban
greening, episodic problem of crop residue burning and forest fires and other
dispersed sources.
Accordingly, the State Action Plan identifies the roadmap for the multi-sector
strategy for air pollution mitigation. The timeframe for implementation is stratified
as short-term (up to one year), medium-term (one-three years) and long-term plans
(three-five years). For each indicator of action, timeline for completion, target,
funding and utilization need to be indicated.
The State Action Plan identifies the areas of improvement needed in infrastructure
and systems, regulatory and institutional capacity, and strategies for compliance
and enforcement.
The geographical scope of this plan is the entire state of Odisha including all
districts. It is recognized that there is a wide variation in the baseline action across
the state due to varying levels of urbanization and development of infrastructure
and systems. More advanced action in key urban centres including the Capital
Region is expected to reduce air pollution exposures substantially.
The State Action Plan aims to meet the national ambient air quality standards state-
wide through a multisector approach that includes transition to affordable clean
fuels and technology in industry, transport and households; mobility transition by
scaling up mass transit, electrification of vehicles, vehicle fleet renewal, inclusive
street infrastructure to promote walking and cycling and low emissions zones, and
strategies to reduce personal vehicle usage among others; circular economy for
material recovery from waste to prevent its dumping and burning; dust management
from construction and demolition, roads and open areas and greening measures;
and stringent time-bound implementation strategies with improved monitoring
and compliance systems.
This aims to reduce health risk from air pollution as the state-level disease burden
estimates of 2017 carried out by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
along with other agencies show that air pollution is the second-largest risk factor
responsible for premature deaths in Odisha. If air pollution concentration can be
lowered, life expectancy in Odisha can increase by 1.2 years – this on a cumulative
population-wide basis can be a significant benefit.

ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
2. Guiding principles
The roadmap of the State Action Plan is guided by the vision of meeting the clean
air standards for:
• Reducing integrated exposures to protect public health and improve life
expectancy and productivity.
• Need equitous, inclusive, affordable, innovative approaches and protection of
vulnerable groups from the toxic risk.
• Need science-based air quality management with compliance and accountability
framework.
• Enable multi-sector and a system-based approach for aligned action across the
sectors.
• State Action Plan is an opportunity to take an airshed-based approach towards
air pollution mitigation to minimize regional influence on local air pollution.

3. Integration of Mission LiFE
(Lifestyle for Environment)
Mission LiFE was launched by the Government of India in 2022 as a global
movement to safeguard the environment from the impact of climate change. It
follows three strategies:
i) Nudging individuals to practice simple yet effective environment friendly
actions in their lives (demand);
ii) Enabling industries and markets to respond swiftly to the changing demand
(supply);
iii) Influencing government and industrial policy to support both sustainable
consumption and production (policy).
MoEFCC issued an Office Memorandum on 23 January 2023, that directed all
State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) and
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) of the NCAP cities to incorporate relevant actions of
Mission LiFE in state and city action plans to improve air quality with monitorable
targets.
As per this Office Memorandum, “Implementation of Mission LiFE is mandatory
as part of the state and city action plans and fund provision under NCAP and
15th Finance Commission performance grant including convergence of resources
from other Union and state government schemes. These may be utilised for
implementation of these activities. Sanction of funds under NCAP for next financial
year are linked to achievement targets provided under the Mission LiFE component.
CPCB will enable a provision on PRANA portal for inclusion of Mission LiFE
components in respective Action Plans for reporting and monitoring of progress…”
Based on this, CPCB has provided a reporting format for relevant actions under
Mission LiFE to be include in Clean Air Action Plans.
CPCB has identified 14 action points from Mission LiFE which can improve air
quality under NCAP. These are as follows:
• Action no 2: Use of public transport wherever possible
• Action no 5: Use bicycles for local or short commute
• Action no 7: Prefer CNG/EVs over petrol and diesel
• Action no 39: Prefer non-plastic eco-friendly cutlery during gatherings and
events

Installed capacity of power procured by GRIDCO is a combination of state thermal (2,537 MW), state hydro (2,083 MW),
renewable energy (1,159 MW) and central sector (2,240 MW). Demand and availability of power shows that the state has
surplus power. Renewable energy contributes 14.45 per cent of total power generation.
The state is also urbanizing. The state urban population that has grown from 16.7 per cent in 2011 to 18 per cent in 2021,
is projected to grow to 21 per cent in 2036. The state covers an area of 60,119 square miles (155,707 square km) with
a population of 41,947,358 as per the 2011 census. It is a tropical wet-dry climatic region with annual rainfall of about
1,500 mm.

The State Action Plan has taken cognizance of this and has integrated the relevant action
points as per the format suggested in the respective pollution sectors of this Action Plan
separately.

4. Air Quality monitoring and
management
4.1 Air Quality Monitoring
Air quality monitoring has begun to expand in the state. There are about 38 manual
monitoring stations in 16 cities and 12 real-time monitoring stations in 10 cities (see
Table 1: Manual monitoring stations in Odisha and Table 2: Continuous ambient
air quality monitoring stations in Odisha). Major cities are yet to set up more real-
time monitors. The monitors are concentrated in urban centres.
Air quality monitoring needs to be further strengthened to track changes in air
quality over time, identify pollution hotspots and exposure patterns, and inform
action plans.

The manual stations monitor particulate matter (PM) of sizes less than 10 microns
(PM10) and in some cases PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO ), and sulphur dioxide
2
(SO ). The real-time monitoring station monitors particulate matter (both PM10
2
and PM2.5), gaseous pollutants (SO , NO , ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic
2 2
compounds and ammonia) and meteorological parameters such as temperature,
relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, pressure, solar radiation.
The long-term data of PM10 from the manual monitoring stations is available from
the CPCB Envis centre database. Manual stations provide data for two days in a
week, and there is a time lag.
The real-time daily trend is needed for daily calculation of air quality index for
public information systems and graded response action plan (GRAP) during high
pollution days. Criteria pollutants, which include PM10, PM2.5, NO , SO , ozone,
2 2
and CO, are considered for GRAP implementation as these have serious short-term
health impacts (in addition to longer-term health impacts) on those suffering from
cardiac and respiratory conditions especially during smog episodes.
The expansion of real-time monitoring stations will help in taking more responsive
action in the city. It may also be supported by air pollution forecasting and
assessment of the regional movement of pollution.
17
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Expansion of the monitoring grid can enable a multi-pollutant approach to control
critical gases, including nitrogen dioxide and ozone. This can also help control
secondary particulate matters that are formed in the atmosphere.
4.2 Air Quality Trend in Odisha
Non-attainment status of a city implies consistently high levels of air pollutants
above the national ambient air quality standards. In Odisha, there are seven non-
attainment cities namely Angul, Balasore, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Kalinganagar,
Rourkela and Talcher. These cities have been identified as non-attainment based
on the PM10 levels. While a predominant pollutant is considered a reason for non-
attainment, the air in urban areas is laced with numerous pollutants - of these 12
are regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As
cities are setting up more monitoring stations, new areas of high exposure or high
air pollution can be identified. In the longer term, emissions must be permanently
reduced so that the NAAQS is maintained at least for 98 per cent of the days in
a year (as per the Air Act, 1981) and peak pollution episodes are prevented. This
requires a more comprehensive action plan at the state level which is time-bound
and requires a targeted reduction over time.
To meet the NAAQS, it may help to assess the target reduction required. As per
the international best practices, such as the method used by the US Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA), a rolling annual average of the previous three years
is taken to define the base pollution level and, accordingly, targets for pollution
reductions are estimated to guide action and prepare action plans. Trend analysis
helps to understand the impact of actions on long-term ambient concentration.
If a similar method is applied for the cities of Odisha based on the annual data
available from CPCB Envis centre air quality database, the indicative reduction
target can be worked out for the cities. The baseline year for the reduction target
is considered as 2018-20. In all the 16 cities where data is available from the Envis
centre database, cities have to reduce their annual average PM10 concentration
varying from 1 per cent in Berhampur to 116 per cent in Paradeep and Rajgangpur
each to meet the NAAQS standard (see Graph 1: NAMP Station-wise PM10
reduction target in cities of Odisha). Also, 2020 was a unique year with pandemic
induced lockdowns which reduced pollution levels substantially. Recent data for
PM10 was also available from the real-time monitoring stations at Brajrajnagar
and Talcher which requires a reduction of 31 per cent and 33 per cent respectively
in PM10 levels to meet the standard (see Graph 2: Reduction target of PM10 based
on the real-time monitoring for the cities of Odisha).

ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
These reduction targets are expected to define the level of detail and stringency
needed in action to achieve clean air. However, it is important to emphasize
that a more effective air quality profile will emerge once real-time monitoring
is established in all cities. It is evident that manual monitoring underestimates
pollution compared to real-time monitoring. PM2.5 is monitored in 12 real-time
monitoring stations which have been recently set up in 10 cities of the state. The
long-term and trend data is only available from two cities which are Brajrajnagar
and Talcher (see Graph 3: Reduction target of PM2.5 based on real-time monitoring
for the cities of Odisha).

Note: 3 years Annual average of PM2.5 concentration is based on mean of daily values recorded at CAAQM stations
Source: CSE analysis of CPCB’s real-time air quality data
4.3 Long-term trend of annual average PM10
The available data of PM10 and PM2.5 from real-time monitoring stations was
analysed from 2019 to 2022. A reduction in PM10 levels by 42 per cent was observed
in Brajrajnagar and almost 55 per cent reduction was seen in Talcher between 2019
and 2022 (see Graph 4: PM10 trend based on real-time monitoring station from
2019-22 in Odisha cities).
A slight increase in PM2.5 concentration was seen in Brajrajnagar and a reduction
of 19 per cent was seen in Talcher between 2019 and 2022 (see Graph 5: PM2.5
20
trend based on real-time monitoring station from 2019-22 in Odisha cities). Also,
as per the available data, levels of gaseous pollutants like SO and NO are well
2 2
within the prescribed limit of 50 and 40 microgramme per cum.

4.4 Hotspot identification
The seven non-attainment cities have identified hotspot areas and prepared plans
to implement the same. This can help identify local sources of pollution for hyper
local action plans and to control pollution at the local level.
Table 3: List of hotspot areas

2. Bypass Chhaka including Talcher Station and Ghantapada
3. Baghuabul area
4.5. Air pollution forecasting
Though currently air pollution forecasting systems are not available in the state, a
roadmap may be adopted to enable its adoption. This can help to take preemptive
and preventive action to protect public health and refine the action strategies. The
non-attainment cities may be prioritized for its adoption.
4.6 Contribution of pollution sources to air quality
For effective air quality management, a detailed assessment of air pollution sources,
their relative contribution to the pollution load and and their concentration in the
ambient air are necessary. Such assessment can also help to understand the share
of secondary particles (that form in the atmosphere from other gaseous pollutants
from combustion sources, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile
22
organic compounds, etc.). A state level inventory may also be considered to support
state level action plan and enable target-oriented strategies and actions.
Currently, source apportionment and emission inventory studies have been initiated
in non-attainment cities of Angul, Talcher, Kalinganagar, Rourkela, Cuttack and
Bhubaneswar. In Balasore it is in the proposal stage.
These are expected to refine the action source-wise strategies. While during summer,
the influence of dust on particulate concentration increases, its share during winter
reduces and the contribution of combustion sources (vehicles, industry, biomass
burning among others) increases.
Additionally, a rapid study for Angul and Talcher was done in August 2020 by the
State Pollution Control Board. This shows that in the Talcher-Angul area, which is
an industrial and mining area, mines contribute about 78 per cent and 93 per cent
of the PM10 in Angul and Talcher respectively. A detailed SA and EI study for the
entire region is important and can help to inform the policy and implementation
strategy (see Graph 6: Relative contribution of PM10 from major sources in Angul
and Talcher).

Talcher
Source: August, 2020, Rapid study on Emission inventory and source apportionment for Angul and Talcher
4.7 Regional action
There is growing evidence now of the regional influence on local pollution due
to transboundary movements between upwind and downwind areas that require
integrated and harmonized action across the region or the airshed. NCAP has
23
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
recognized the idea of regional approach and mentions that a comprehensive
regional plan needs to be formulated incorporating the inputs from the regional
source apportionment studies. State level plan is the first step in that direction to
reduce the influence of regional air pollution on local air quality. The state-wide
action that is envisaged in the SAP will enable that process.
4.8 Hybrid air quality monitoring for wider coverage
In addition to the regulatory monitoring grid network it is possible to adopt multi-
dimensional air quality monitoring approaches to address data gaps and map
exposures. As is already being practiced in other states, satellite-based monitoring
can help to generate air quality data for a much larger region. The NCAP has taken
this approach on board to address spatial and temporal data gaps. This does not
replace ground-based regulatory-grade measurements of air pollution but improves
the accuracy of the estimates and calibration and validation of data. Satellite remote
sensing-based estimation of pollution from satellite retrievals of Aerosol Optical
Depth (AOD) is a useful source of data for ground-level estimations with a potential
for a wider regional coverage.
Additionally, high-density sensor-based monitoring networks are also an
opportunity to fill data gaps and map exposures around pollution sources. The
NCAP has taken on board the application of sensor monitors that are much
cheaper than regulatory monitors. Under the ongoing Smart City programme of
the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), cities, such as Bhubaneswar,
have installed sensors for smart monitoring and digitization. However, the CPCB
gave a clarification to all state pollution control boards and pollution control
committees in its advisory on 25 March 2022 that air quality data generation using
any technology including low-cost sensors other than that specified in NAAQS
is not to be used for regulatory purposes as its accuracy, linearity, reliability and
long-term performance are not yet fully established. The CPCB has constituted
a committee for development of a network of air quality monitoring to frame
operational guidelines, protocol for monitoring air quality and also to optimize
the CAAQMS requirements. The CPCB is considering a pilot study to evaluate the
efficacy of sensors. The Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) is currently developing a
performance standard for sensors to address issues of quality and validation of data
from them.
However, CPCB has stated that the SPCBs may examine the use of low-cost sensors
for other qualitative applications such as relative assessment and comparison of air
24
quality owing to various dust control measures and interventions from time to time
at construction sites, roads, right of ways, open spaces, hotspots etc. across the state.
4.9 Roadmap for air quality monitoring and pollution
source assessment
• Implement a state-wide plan for expansion of air quality monitoring network
for wider coverage of population, land-use, urban and rural scale, background
levels.
• Expand real-time air quality monitoring, public information system based
on daily air quality index and adoption of graded response action plan. Also
enable air pollution forecasting.
• Carry out source apportionment and emissions inventory in the key regions of
the state.
• Auditing of air quality monitoring systems for quality control of data.
• Adopt hybrid monitoring systems including satellite based monitoring for
much wider coverage of the state and population.
25
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
5. Industrial pollution
Odisha has witnessed substantial industrial growth and increase in mineral
production. The industry structure is dominated by mining industries, iron and steel,
aluminium, ferro alloys and chemical fertilizers and thermal power plants. There is
also a special challenge of small- and medium-scale industries that face issues with
respect to adoption of emissions control systems and clean fuels. Industrial setups
are also vulnerable to fugitive emissions from facilities such as stone crushers or
mineral grinding, etc.; material handling and loading/unloading; open burning of
industrial waste; heavy reliance on diesel generator sets; and dust pollution caused
by the movement of heavy-duty trucks and goods vehicles, particularly on unpaved
roads in industrial areas, etc. Clean air action would need to address each of these
aspects.
5.1. Industry inventory and compliance
The state of Odisha maintains a detailed inventory of the industrial enterprises
within its jurisdiction, including the seventeen polluting categories and the others,
along with their compliance status (see Graph 7: Industry profile of Odisha other
than 17 polluting categories).
The state PCB also plans on making a detailed fuel inventory for its industry sector
to estimate the emission inventory and fuel consumption. This will enable the state
to take necessary measures to reduce un-regulated emissions.

Source: Odisha SPCB
26
The enforcement mechanism captures the status of compliance with the emissions
control standards and emissions control requirements based on periodic inspection
and the challans issued (see Graph 8: Compliance status of various categories of
industries other than the 17-polluting categories and Graph 9: Compliance status
of various categories of industries under the 17-polluting categories). This helps to
bring out the status of compliance and non-compliance.

27
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
REGION-WISE INDUSTRY CATEGORIES
(OTHER THAN THE 17 POLLUTING
INDUSTRIES)
There is a distinct variation in the type and distribution of
industrial units across the key regions of Odisha. Information
available for Angul, Balasore, Cuttack, Behrampur,
Bhubaneswar, Jharsuguda, Kalinganagar, Paradeep,
Rayagada, Rourkela, and Sambalpur bring out this diversity.
The key air polluting industries that are outside the list of 17
most polluting categories include stone crushers, stone-metal
quarry, brick kilns, hot mix plants, cement products, coal stack
yard, coal processing, minor mineral mining, among others.
28
29
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
The State PCB has issued 19 show cause notices in total to the industries falling under
the 17 polluting industry categories. Other than the high-polluting categories, the
State PCB has also issued 106 show cause notices and 164 closure directions; and
filed 614 legal cases. About 93 actions have been initiated and are under process.
5.2. Status and initiative on critically polluted areas
The State of Odisha does not have any critically polluted areas (CPA) since 2018.
Currently, there are two severely polluted areas - Paradeep Port (2021 plan), and
Jharsuguda Area (2010 plan when it was CPA) for which plans have been prepared
and are under implementation.
The OSPCB has also developed a novel star rating program. This program is an
initiative to inform residents in Odisha about the pollution from industrial plants
in and around their localities. The Star Rating program utilizes the continuously
monitored emissions data from major industrial plants to categorize industries
from most polluting (1-star) to least polluting (5-star).
OSPCB’s star-rating program is a transparency initiative. Besides informing
residents and industries, the program also aims to strengthen OSPCB’s regulatory
efforts to reduce pollution in the state by engaging local communities, civil
society groups and the media. The entire project is funded by the Tata Centre for
Development (TCD).
5.3. Switching to cleaner fuels and technologies
The OSPCB has issued notifications on clean fuels and adopted action points to
make transition to cleaner fuels and technologies. The key focus is on replacing
polluting fuels like coal, pet-coke and furnace oil. The PCB has issued notification
(Notification No. 22737, dtd. 07/11/2011 in F&E Dept) which gives the list of the
approved fuels and guidelines for both fuel oil and pet coke usage. Use of furnace
oil is banned. Petcoke cannot be used as combustion fuel but only as feedstock in
industries/processes where SO gets absorbed, such as cement, lime/dolo kiln,
2
calcined pet coke, aluminium smelter, gasification, calcium carbide and graphite
electrode subject to CTO/CTE.
Sulphur content of coal in Odisha is usually low - around 0.3 to 0.5 per cent.
To enable adoption of cleaner fuels like natural gas, distribution projects have been
undertaken by GAIL. Implementation is underway and is expected to be completed
by 2045. The expanding natural gas pipeline consists of JHBDPL that covers 13
districts viz. Angul, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Jagatsinghpur, Japur,
30
Jharsuguda, Kendrapara, Khordha, Puri, Sambalpur and Sundargarh with pipeline
length of 769 km. In Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, city gas network pipelines and
associated facilities are under execution.
In the meantime, the state government is also promoting cleaner production.
Mostly the iron and steel industries are adopting cleaner production by adopting,
continuous casting, heat recovery of waste gases i.e., coke oven gas, blast furnace gas,
BOF gas and their gainful utilization as fuels inside the plant. Clean fuel transition in
the industrial sector is critical for clean air action. This will require rapid transition
to natural gas and reliable supply of electricity for industrial processes at affordable
rates.
Small-scale units will require inventorization and assessment of pollution control
potential especially if there is dependence on small boilers. It is also necessary to
address the emissions control from manufacturing industries, especially metal-
based industries, that use furnaces which largely operate on fuels like coal, wood
and liquid fuel. The roadmap needs to enable transition to electric arc furnaces
wherever feasible. All industries using furnaces need to have well maintained
air pollution control devices. Furnaces and industrial processes should run on
affordable electricity.
5.4. Control fugitive emissions
There are several industrial enterprises that are responsible for huge amounts of
fugitive emissions and dust generation. These include mining and different phases
of crushing and storage. Stone crushers, mineral grinding and brick kilns are among
the most prominent sources. The responsible units need to adopt dust suppressant
measures and establish crusher zones meeting the siting guidelines for proper
monitoring.
Further, industries under the 17 high polluting categories in the state either have
some fugitive emission control technology or procedure in place. Depending upon
the type of industry, emissions and the availability, the following technologies are
currently deployed in the state for dust extraction and dust suppression:
• Dust extraction systems viz, ESPs, bag houses, and multi cyclones and wet
scrubbers.
• Dust suppression systems viz., a) Dry Fog Dust Suppression Systems b) Wet
Fog Dust Suppression Systems c) Water sprinkling systems d) Fog cannon e)
Rain gun f) Pneumatic dust handling system.
31
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
As mentioned before, mining is one of the primary activities in the industry sector
of the state. Stone crushers operating with poor implementation of environmental
guidelines cause high fugitive emissions. But the degree of their impact on ambient
air and nearby inhabitants goes unaccounted. Since this industry does not have
stack emissions, no air monitoring is required to be done by unit operators. The
following action points can be implemented to control the fugitive emissions:
• Shift from wet suppression to dry extraction system for dust control
• Proper infrastructure to arrest fugitive dust
• Declaration of crusher zones and relocating all units to these zones
• Installation of ambient air monitoring stations near crusher zones and conduct
continuous compliance monitoring of the establishments
• Strengthening of state guidelines
• Display of consent information on gate
5.5. Brick kilns
These require detailed inventory to identify location and status of kiln technology,
emissions control systems and fuel used. In Odisha most of the brick kilns are
seasonal. A Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) has been developed for
brick kilns. This is a platform to improve environmental compliance of brick
manufacturing units. Available data shows that there are 6 brick kilns in Angul;
8 kilns in Rourkela; 11 in Bhubaneswar (SAS area) but these are not in operation.
Cuttack has 14 brick kilns but 13 have not applied for consent to operate.
Brick kilns need to make rapid transition from traditional draft kiln technology
to improved zig zag technology. The MoEFCC issued a gazette notification on
22 February 2022 on emissions standards and kiln technology. This provides for
tighter particulate emissions standards, and specification of stack height by capacity
of brick kilns. All new brick kilns will be allowed only with zigzag technologies or
vertical shaft or on piped natural gas. The existing ones will also have to follow the
same provisions within one year if they are within 10-km radius of non-attainment
cities, and two years for other areas. They need to follow process emissions/fugitive
dust emissions control guidelines. The ash needs to be fully re-utilized in brick
making. Approach roads will have to be paved and transport vehicles covered. Also,
minimum siting criteria have been established.
5.6. Industrial waste burning
The industrial areas and clusters also require well defined industrial waste
collection system for proper disposal. Normally such systems are devised for
hazardous industrial wastes. But non-hazardous waste also requires collection and
disposal systems, otherwise these will get burnt in the open. Any such instance of
32
industrial waste burning in the state can be reduced by planning and streamlining
the collection and disposal of industrial waste to prevent burning. Along with this,
making industries and industry associations liable for safe collection and disposal
is also equally important.
5.7. Thermal power plants
Odisha has seven power plants located across four districts that require to meet
the emissions standards of 2015 in the timeframe of 2025-26. According to the
MoEFCC classification, TPPs whose stacks are within an aerial distance of a 10-
km radius of NCR or cities with a million-plus population are in Category A.
However, the units in Odisha fall either under the ‘B’ or ‘C’ category. The deadline
for compliance for these category of power plants is either 2025 or 2026.
A quicker roadmap is needed to phase in the new standards. The Central Electricity
Authority provides the status of implementation of emissions standards in each
power plant (see Table 4: Thermal power plants in Odisha state: status of compliance
with 2015 emissions standards). A transition plan for each plant needs to be drawn
up to enable that process and ensure compliance. This will allow tighter regulations
of particulate matter emissions, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and mercury. The
standards are designed to ensure that high pollution and carbon are not locked in
the new infrastructure for many more years—especially when industrialization is
growing in the state.
Some units are more than 20 years old. These meet the older emissions standards.
A phase-out plan will be needed to progressively close the older and more polluting
thermal power plants and to move to cleaner fuels like natural gas. This will require
more stringent stack monitoring with the help of continuous emissions monitoring
systems (CEMS). Fly ash utilization will have to be further scaled up.

Need fly ash management: The state government is encouraging the use of fly ash
bricks. Based on the notices issued by the government, new construction is required
to use fly ash bricks. The government has also provided incentives for transportation
of fly ash to the manufacturer’s site to encourage more fly ash brick kilns. Currently,
brick kilns with mobile chimneys are banned in the state and the ones with fixed
chimneys are required to acquire environmental clearance for operation.
Industrial DG sets in industry: Use of diesel generator (DG) sets for captive power
generation in industrial areas can be a significant contributor to local air pollution
and toxic exposures. By improving access to natural gas and electricity, use of DG
34
sets can be reduced. A phase out plan is possible to replace DG sets with gas-based
sets. The operational cost of gas-based sets can be lower as CNG prices are lower
than the diesel prices. The options of dual fuel mode (piped natural gas and diesel)
and retrofitment of Emission Control Devices (ECD) in DG sets of more than 800
KVA capacity are also possible as per the CPCB guidelines.
5.8. CEMS monitoring in industries
It is necessary to strengthen smart monitoring in industries with the help of
continuous emission monitoring (CEMS) for efficient and transparent monitoring
for compliance. This requires a strategy for ensuring correct CEMS installation,
quality control of data, proper calibration, technology selection, operation and
maintenance, adequate skills, and periodic check of CEMS performance. Quality
control of data is needed for adoptions of market-based mechanisms like emission
trading system and star labelling system.
5.9. Mining in Odisha
The state has a very active mining sector due to its rich mineral deposits. Major
mineral mines include coal, iron and manganese, chromite, bauxite, limestone and
dolomite (see Table 5: Major mines under consent administration of State Pollution
Control Board).

Pollution) Act, 1981. The State Pollution Control Board regulates the mines under
consent administration as specified in section 25/26 of the Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act, 1981.
35
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Consent to operate is granted to the mines under the above provisions stipulating
conditions related to prevention and control of environmental pollution. Status
compliance of the stipulated conditions is periodically verified by the Board officials
and appropriate action is taken based on the status compliance of the stipulation.
Key strategies for industrial pollution control
The areas of recommendations for the industry sector include:
• Transition to clean fuels as is consistent with the action point on clean fuels in
LiFE MISSION.
• Addressing fugitive emissions and industrial waste burning
• Kiln technology transition in brick kilns
• Strengthen CEMS-based smart monitoring of industries
• Adoption of emission control systems in industrial DG sets and improving
access to reliable electricity
• Meet 2015 emissions standards in all power plants and phase out old plants

6. Vehicular pollution
Odisha is urbanizing and motorizing rapidly. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are high
growth cities and have a substantial vehicle stock. According to the VAHAN
database of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Odisha
has approximately 10 million registered vehicles which accounts for 3.4 per cent
of the total registered vehicles in India. More than 60 per cent of these vehicles
in Odisha have been registered in the past decade. (see Graph 10: Year-wise total
number of registered vehicles in Odisha and Graph 11: Vehicle category-wise annual
registration in state of Odisha).
Annual vehicle registrations data shows that between FY 2011-12 and FY 2018-19,
vehicle registration volumes doubled (from 4.27 lakhs to 8.58 lakhs per annum) and
constantly created a new peak every subsequent year. Though in the recent past the
rate has declined by 30 per cent due to the pandemic, the number of registrations in
FY 2021-22 was 5.3 lakh vehicles. In Bhubaneswar the share of car registration is
higher than the rest of the state and constitutes as much as 23 per cent.
Two wheelers accounted for the lion’s share at 82 per cent, followed by cars (8 per
cent), goods carriers (5 per cent) and three-wheelers (3 per cent). A vehicle category-
wise analysis reveals that in FY 2011-2019, annual registration of buses reduced
drastically (from 3,258 to 1,394 per annum), and mobility requirements are being
fulfilled with the use of personal vehicles, mostly two-wheelers and cars. The surge
in travel demand has resulted in heavy dependence on private modes of transport.
The high personal vehicle percentages create overcrowding and congestion during
peaks on the main roads in the cities.
The annual registration of two-wheelers and cars has expanded by 2.1 and 1.8
times respectively in the same time period to meet this gap in mobility. In addition,
demand for goods and services has increased along with an expansion in e-commerce
in tandem. This has in turn increased demand for goods carriers.
The rapid increase of vehicular numbers is adding to the problem of air pollution.
Over 99 per cent of the registered vehicles are propelled by internal combustion
engines powered by fossil fuels.
Vehicles are one of the prominent sources of pollution as there is a rapid increase in
the vehicular population in Odisha.
41

Graph 11: Vehicle category-wise annual registration in state of Odisha
Source: Computed based on VAHAN database
Due to the progressive tightening of vehicle emissions standards, there has been
a substantive improvement in tailpipe emissions from new vehicles. From Bharat
Stage I (BS I) to Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emissions standards, particulate emissions
from diesel cars have reduced 31 times and from heavy-duty vehicles by 36 times.
Similarly, NOx emissions from diesel cars have reduced by 6.25 times and from
heavy commercial vehicles by 20 times.
42
While new vehicle technology and emissions control systems have significantly
improved and will continue to improve and reduce tailpipe emissions in driving
conditions, an equally stringent focus is needed to manage on-road vehicles. The
objective is to keep on-road vehicles low emitting during their useful life on the
road and to reduce direct exposure to toxic emissions; accelerate fleet renewal to
leverage emissions gains from the technological advancement with introduction
of BS VI emissions standards, and accelerate zero emissions transition with rapid
electrification of targeted vehicle fleet to meet clean air target. Simultaneously,
transportation and mobility strategies will be implemented to reduce vehicle miles
travelled and achieve at least 80-85 per cent modal share by public transport
systems.
6.1. On-road emission inspection and monitoring
The only programme running right now for emission inspection and monitoring is
the Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate which includes idling emission test.
The petrol vehicles are tested for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and lambda test
whereas diesel vehicles are only tested for smoke opacity, oil temperature, RPM,
etc. PUC norms are linked to the different mass emission standards for vehicles.
There is also an advisory from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for
checking of the malfunctioning light of onboard diagnostic systems at the time
of inspection and to return the vehicle for repair if the light is found to be ‘on’,
indicating a technical problem.
This decentralized testing mechanism is very difficult to monitor for quality control.
Several audits of PUC programmes across states of India have shown low level of
compliance, lack of qualified and skilled PUC operators, inadequate calibration of
machines, lack of knowledge of proper testing procedures, and improper testing
and manual data reporting. Even though PUC centres have been linked with the
central server, PUC database is mostly not usable due to lack of uniform protocol for
recording of data (vehicle/fuel type-wise, age-wise etc.) and the central server is not
amenable for remote monitoring. There are a number of PUC centres operational
in Odisha and also challans are issued for the lack of PUC certificates (see Graph
12: Number of PUC centres in the non-attainment cities of Odisha and Graph 13:
Number of challans issued for the lack of PUC certificate in non-attainment cities
of Odisha).
Improvement in the enforcement systems include linking of the PUC with the
VAHAN database, automatic alert to vehicle owners for renewal of PUC certificates,
linking refuelling with valid PUC certificate and higher penalty. Another
improvement will link the annual vehicle insurance with the PUC. In addition, all
43
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
commercial vehicles must undergo annual roadworthiness and fitness tests under
the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. Setting up of automated high-capacity centralized
testing facilities has a scope of expansion within the state.

44
6.2. Advancement of on-road emissions monitoring
New vehicle technologies have advanced considerably with the tightening of the
mass emission standards from Bharat Stage IV (BS IV) to BS VI. There is a need to
modernize the on-road emissions monitoring techniques and tests to address the
emissions from vehicles in real world driving conditions. This is not possible with
the idling testing under PUC. Remote sensing is one such strategy that has already
been recommended in the clean air action plans of the non-attainment cities of
Odisha. This is an absorption spectroscopy to measure exhaust emissions remotely
as vehicles cross the light path on the road. It can detect CO, NO, NO and HC. This
2
allows large-scale fleet screening without the vehicles being taken for physical tests;
determines average emissions of the fleet and effectively identifies high emitters
based on threshold limit for worst polluters and also detects vehicles with systemic
flaws in vehicle batches that cause high excess emissions.
MoRTH is framing rules for the implementation of this advanced technology
for monitoring of vehicles on the road. MoRTH has framed draft AIS 170 rules
to define the scope of the programme. The remote sensing technology is already
in operation in West Bengal and testing has also begun for Delhi-NCR. Globally,
on-road emissions surveillance has advanced considerably. It is necessary to prepare
a roadmap for its implementation in the capital region on a priority basis.
6.3. Phase-out of old vehicles and scrappage of end-of-
life vehicles
As new vehicles become progressively cleaner with the advancement in mass
emissions standards, older on-road vehicles that deteriorate over time and emit
significantly higher than they are designed to emit, it becomes necessary to renew
and modernize the vehicle fleet. Different states are giving out directives to regulate
the age of vehicles. An order by the transport department of Odisha has stated
that all the government vehicles will be phased out and will be replaced by electric
vehicles. Additionally, the state government will provide loans to government
employees to purchase EVs.
Government of Odisha has provided single window clearance system with regard
to registered vehicle scrapping facility and automated vehicle testing station to be
established in the state through PPP or private investments - based on order no 704
dated 21.01.2022 issued by Commerce and Transport Department.
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on 15 March 2021 has issued:
• G.S.R. 653(E) regarding the Motor Vehicles (Registration and Functions of
Vehicle Scrapping Facility) Rules, 2021, dated 23-09-2021
45
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
• G.S.R 220(E) regarding Concession in Motor Vehicle Taxes against submission

• Sec 59 of the CMV(A) Act, 2019 that provides for fixing age and restricting
plying of unfit vehicles
• AIS 129 that defines the standards for manufacturers on reuse, recycling and
material recovery from vehicles
The CPCB has also issued Guidelines for Environmentally Sound Facilities for
Handling, Processing and Recycling of End-of-Life Vehicles in 2019.
6.4. Controlling emissions from heavy-duty vehicles
The major share of freight traffic originates in 10 states, Odisha being one of them.
The intensity of road-based freight traffic is responsible for high toxic exposure and
source of ambient particulate and nitrogen oxide concentrations. This segment
requires strategies for fleet renewal, clean fuel, energy-saving strategies and reduced
heavy-duty traffic intensity in densely populated areas to reduce toxic exposures.
The state EV policy has given individuals and fleet owners purchase incentives of
Rs 30,000 to the first 5,000 electric goods carriages to be registered in the state;
and waived road tax registration fees and SGST on selling electric goods carriages.
Rourkela, Cuttack, Balasore, Talcher and Angul are using off-peak passenger travel
time to move freight and restrict entry of heavy vehicles into cities during the day,
with periodic inspections. They have also proposed parking and rest areas on the
highways. All these towns are equipped with adequate weigh-in-motion machines
at all the entry points for checking over-loaded vehicles and imposing fines. The
policy has been notified to define routes, permits, fares, vehicle design and safety
standards, and vehicle technology standards for para-transit vehicles but has not
yet been implemented on the ground.
This will also require to promote trucking on clean fuels. Highway-based CNG/
LNG refuelling systems and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles can help to
shift a substantial segment of long-haul trucking and other commercial vehicles to
gas and electricity. Regional route clusters like the capital region can be identified
where such a transition can be prioritized. This will have to be promoted with
highway-based refuelling infrastructure and preferential incentives.
This will also require rationalization of logistics infrastructure to reorganize freight
movement and enable shift to rail-based freight movement; development of
efficient interlinkages with the regional Integrated Freight Complexes aligned with
46
the freight distribution network of the city. Spatial and locational planning can help
to mitigate truck traffic intensity and exposure. More efficient linking with regional
rail-based freight systems and increasing share of rail-based freight will provide
more sustainable solutions. An integrated plan needs to be developed.
The state has a rail network of 5,783 km covering all the districts. The major cities
of Odisha are well connected to all the major cities of India. State Government has
proposed to develop new lines and strengthen existing lines for better connectivity
of the hinterland mining area to the ports. The Government has also proposed
to build rail tracks from the mining heads to the nearest railheads which would
decarbonize the logistics industry.
6.5. Electric vehicles
Currently, the penetration of electric vehicles (battery electric) in the state is
negligible, i.e., just 2 per cent of the total registered vehicles in FY2021-22. However,
the numbers are growing rapidly. During 2021-22, Odisha had registered more
than 10,000 EVs. In 2022, same numbers have been registered within five months.
It is possible to set realistic and achievable targets for each vehicle segment for
the quick transformation. In FY 2021-22, this segment has witnessed around 5.2
per cent electrification of the new fleet. But it offers a much larger opportunity for
about 60-70 per cent electrification as the current incentive programme has already
helped to reach price parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This is
also supported by citizen awareness programmes (see Graph 14: Number of electric
vehicles registered yearly in Odisha).

ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Commercial e-2Ws for aggregator/e-commerce services segment are growing rapidly
along with expansion of e-commerce in food, grocery and other goods deliveries. A
policy mandate and time-bound target can transform this sector to achieve almost
100 per cent conversion to electric. Commercial passenger e-3Ws for individual/
aggregator services has already achieved 17 per cent market penetration in FY
2021-22. Although almost 94 per cent of this development is driven by e-rickshaws,
the sector offers huge potential for transformation. A recent study carried out by
the Centre for Science and Environment in the state capital region shows that the
appropriate interventions can transform 50 to 60 per cent of the current market.
In FY 2021-22, EV penetration level in the state was highest for commercial goods
e-3Ws for individual/e-commerce services at 37 per cent. The high percentage
is however due to the proliferation of small e-carts rather than goods-e-autos.
Three-wheeler goods carriers involved in e-commerce and delivery businesses can
be completely transformed into electric through regulatory intervention. With
improved design of incentive structures, better quality vehicles can be scaled up.
So far, the passenger car segment has been slow to electrify. This is largely because
of high upfront costs, lack of public incentive for personal cars, inadequate charging
infrastructure that increases range anxiety and lack of adequate e-car models in
the market. It is evident that a robust charging ecosystem can help to transform
the segment by 15-20 per cent. The opportunity also exists in targeted support for
government-owned vehicles for 70-80 per cent electrification.
The rate of electrification in commercial passenger e-4Ws for individual/aggregator
services segment is almost negligible, but a definitive policy mandate can transform
the same and help it to achieve almost 100 per cent penetration in ride hailing
services.
The capital region has already set a good example in developing a bus programme
– the Mo bus programme. Its future expansion and modernization can be linked
with ambitious electrification programme to make mass transit carbon neutral
and zero emission. Till date, Capital Region Urban Transport (CRUT) has
inducted 10 e-buses in their service, and 50 more e-buses are being procured. A
strong government mandate for at least 75 per cent EV bus share of all new bus
procurements can transform the bus market and the bus services in this region.
As goods e-carriers/trucks have high mileage and are used more intensely, there is an
opportunity to make them zero emission vehicles. But this segment is yet to witness
adequate product development and product diversity. However, a proper incentive
48
mechanism and mandate can transform 5-10 per cent of the goods vehicles segment
involved in deliveries with substantial benefits.
The state has developed an EV policy, intending to achieve 20 per cent battery
electric vehicles in all vehicle registrations by 2025 and to promote the manufacture
of electric vehicles and their components including batteries. The EV policy has
provided for dedicated funds financed from cesses/levies and budgetary support.
Incentives include 100% SGST reimbursement; 10 per cent capital subsidy - max
limit of Rs 20 lakh per vehicle; concession to SCs, STs, women and industrially
backward districts. Electricity tariff to be notified with special tariff for EV charging.
Batteries are to be labelled for collection of waste and recycling. EV battery
manufacturers to have scheme for collection of batteries and not charge the users
for collection. It will have synergy with current e-waste management. Benchmark
labels of materials to be recycled from batteries. Policy for recyclers is to be notified.
To make it a successful programme, some on-ground challenges will have to be
addressed. These include price parity, improving product diversity, improving
range to minimize top up charging in a single trip, retrofitment with regulatory
and quality checks, customized charging (night time-home and on-street charging,
public charging), performance-linked funding, restrictions/disincentives on diesel/
IC autos, etc.
Demand incentives need to be strengthened, branding of e-drive needs to be done
to stimulate consumer interest, focus needs to be put on delivery fleet and OEM-led
service provision.
As per the UMI report 2019 released by BDA, due to the low-carbon mobility plan
(LCMP), GHG emissions will drop by 20-30 per cent by 2040.
6.6. CNG-operated vehicles
The state has promoted vehicles running on CNG. At this moment, only public
transport vehicles running on CNG are available in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.
However, district administrations have planned to promote electric vehicles for
public transport. Currently, some electric vehicles are being used by the municipality
for door-to-door collection of solid wastes in the towns of Rourkela and Balasore.
GAIL has planned to build 15 CNG stations in Bhubaneswar and 10 others in Cuttack.
There is a target to convert 30,000 diesel-run auto-rickshaws in Bhubaneswar
and Cuttack to CNG. Bhubaneshwar has two CNG-filling stations. Two more at
49
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Khandagiri and Tamando. Cuttack city has two stations. Bhubaneswar is laying 65
km of steel pipeline and 1,026 inch-km of MDPE network in next 5 years. Thirteen
CNG stations (one in bus depot) are being set up. Conversion of 45,000 vehicles to
CNG is being planned in the next five years. Cuttack is laying 41 km of steel pipeline
and 989 inch-km of MDPE network for distribution of CGD. Conversion of 18,000
vehicles to CNG is in the cards. This all is planned to happen in the next 5 years.
There is a provision of sending liquefied CNG in cryogenic tankers from Dahej to
Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Natural gas has also been supplied from Kakinada in
Andhra Pradesh. All these developments have created the opportunity to expand
the CNG fleet in the state.
6.7. Public transport
Vehicular pollution control will require transformative changes in the transportation
and mobility patterns in the region to reduce the number and usage of vehicles,
travel distances and traffic intensity. The heavy dependence on private transport is
also attributed to the underperforming public transport services.
In 2019, data released from the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA),
shows that two-wheelers have the highest share at 53 per cent, followed by auto-
rickshaws at 16 per cent. Though the data for 2019 shows that the mode share of
buses is around 10 per cent, since the last 3 years the ridership of buses has increased
by 4 times (see Graph 15: Modal share in Bhubaneswar, 2018).
Khurda, Cuttack, and Puri districts are among the major urban centres, accounting
for over a third of the state’s total urban population. Bhubaneswar is a large urban
agglomeration including neighbouring districts of Cuttack, Jatni, Khurda town,
Chowdwar, Barang and Puri. Greater travel demand has been created in this region
as a result of the growth in urban and economic activities.
The district administrations of Talcher, Rourkela, Balasore, Kalinga Nagar and
Angul have planned to promote the use of electric vehicles for public transport.
Rourkela has been sanctioned one e-bus which CRUT will operate. And the other
cities are in the discussion and planning stage.
50
Graph 15: Modal share in Bhubaneswar, 2018
Source: UMI 2019 report, BDA.
Bus service: In Odisha, OSRTC, the state owned intra-city public transport agency,
operates around 22,158 buses, of which 10 per cent are owned by OSRTC and 90 per
cent by private entities. During the past five years, the growth rate of procurement
of buses has decreased. OSRTC has received various awards for its best practice in
terms of fuel savings and operations. The agency conducts safety and eco-driving
training for drivers and conductors on a regular basis.
Bus service in the capital region: The Bhubaneswar Bus Modernization Plan
released by Bhubaneswar Smart City Limited, has demarcated 38.7 kms of priority
transit corridors which will require 148 new electric buses to ferry 192,000
passengers daily. The smart city has also suggested deploying 500 e-rickshaws,
allied infrastructure, and charging stations. But there is a huge gap in the current
purchase of e-buses and e-rickshaws.
There has been substantial improvement in bus service provided by Capital Region
Urban Transport (CRUT) in the capital region. In 2018 there were around 130
buses on 10 routes with unreliable services and unclean buses. Currently, around
250 buses ply on 32 routes including electric buses with reliable services and clean
buses. From 50 bus queue shelters the numbers have increased to 200. During
the year 2021, CRUT procured 10 electric buses for Bhubaneswar. In 2023 40
additional e-buses are going to be inducted in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to mitigate
air pollution. CRUT buses operate on 22 routes at a frequency of 1-6 buses per hour
during a 17-hour operation cycle from 5.30 AM to 10.30 PM.
51
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
These initiatives have increased passenger convenience (including seating area,
backlit signage board with MO Bus network map, and GPS-enabled passenger
information system). At present, around 140 BQS are also equipped with the
bike-sharing system (MO CYCLE), integrated to support last-mile connectivity.
Procurement of 150 buses, including 50 electric buses, for wider coverage and
better services is ongoing. An innovative strategy is to integrate the Mo bus service
with electric three-wheelers for last mile connectivity. Around 50 e-autos have been
deployed for this purpose.
The bus transport ridership has seen a significant improvement in Bhubaneswar
and Cuttack i.e., from 50,000/day in 2018 to more than 200,000/day. CRUT also
procured 100 BS VI buses for the hockey world cup event in Rourkela. CRUT has
funded the development of the ‘MO Bus’ app which provides data such as ETA, live
location of buses, route details and trip planner.
There are also multiple private operators running buses (72 in number) along
specific routes, mainly connecting Cuttack and Khurda (BCBMP report, 2018).
The State EV policy has encouraged the purchase of e-buses by exempting road tax
and registration fees for the first four years. A subsidy of 10 per cent (maximum
limit of Rs 20 lakh per vehicle) is also extended to the buyers for passenger buses
registered in the state with interest subvention of 5 per cent on loans.
Policy and schemes and criteria to be implemented for the bus system in cities
of Odisha. Cities with more than 4 lakh population to have 60 buses per lakh of
population;
• Cities with less than 4 lakh population have 40 buses per lakh of population
(as per the service level benchmark of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs).
- At least 50% of new buses will be electric
• Smaller towns – Create/strengthen bus service for clusters of towns as the
small towns cannot have dedicated bus service
• Set target for bus route network augmentation (aligned with population
distribution for service coverage as per MoHUA’s service-level benchmark of
average waiting time to be less than 4 min at bus stops, etc) – with monitoring
and reporting requirements
• ITS system for managing bus fleet operation and for passenger information
system for service delivery in each ward
• Fare policy and fare integration
• Implementation of multi-modal integration policy
52
6.7.1. Intermediate public transport (IPT)
In addition to providing last-mile services and connectivity between modes in
large cities, auto-rickshaws – the most popular intermediate public transport
system - also serve as the major mode of transportation in smaller cities and towns.
At present, there are around 209,572 passenger autos and 2,349 e-rickshaws
functioning across the state. This is an opportunity to replace them with electric
autos in a phased manner. With electric mobility adoption, three-wheelers can be
completely shifted to electric. Auto-rickshaws are a reliable feeder system and can
integrate larger transportation networks. City-wise planning is needed to organize
these for effective deployment.
This is in line with NITI Aayog’s prediction that approximately 70 per cent
electrification of two- and three-wheeler fleets is possible by 2030. Additionally,
targeted electrification will be needed for taxi aggregators and ride-hailing services.
Odisha’s EV policy has waived off road tax, registration and permit fees, introduced
open permit system, and provides incentives for purchasing and scrapping of
existing older vehicles. Recently, the government has launched a web portal for
people to claim state incentives for the purchase of EVs.
To initiate the transition from conventional autos, especially diesel autos, to
e-rickshaws and to organize the rickshaw operators in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack,
the city authority plans to introduce 500 e-rickshaws. The municipality of Talcher
and Angul are targeting to boost the sale of e-rickshaws. Rourkela and Balasore are
operating over 30 e-rickshaws each as intermediate public transport. Also about
53 e-rickshaws are in operation in Rourkela and Balasore for door-to-door waste
collection.
A phased plan to replace diesel three-wheelers and its integration with other services
can meet the mobility needs while reducing pollution.
6.8. Non-motorized transport
Bhubaneswar Smart City Ltd. has launched several schemes to implement NMT
plans and policies. Already considerable infrastructure has been created with
continuous carriageway, wide sidewalks, dedicated cycle tracks and provision
of road infrastructures – public toilet/seating space/vending space/parking, etc.
Bhubaneswar has implemented 49.7 km of footpaths and 40 km of cycle tracks.
Smart Janpath has been conceptualized as complete streets. Cycle sharing with
1,500 cycles under Mo Cycle has been started and 11 km of cycle tracks, painted red
to segregate bicycle lanes within the right of way, have been laid.
53
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Under the smart city mission, a public bike sharing system called MO CYCLE is
operated by CRUT with a fleet of 2,000 cycles and 363 stations. It is accessed
through a mobile app. The Low Carbon Mobility Plan (LCMP), a long-term (20
years) strategic vision document for mobility, has been taken on board by the
Bhubaneswar Development Authority and a city-level strategy is being framed which
is in its final stages. Based on a rigorous examination of large data sets, including
existing and prospective land use, transit routes and stops, travel patterns, cross-
sectoral analyses, etc., the LCMP has proposed a 180-km citywide bicycle network.
BDA has started awareness-raising initiatives such as NMT day every week or month
and encourages its use for government employees. Street reclaiming initiatives like
Patha Utsav in which parts of streets are closed for motorized vehicles, cycle days or
cycle-to-work events, pedestrian safety drives, etc. are being promoted. Due to poor
planning, lack of awareness and poor maintenance, the cycles are not being used.
The street design guidelines for Bhubaneswar 2021 released by the BDA, include
various design standards with the aim of reducing noise and air pollution in public
spaces. This will enhance urban landscape, street orientation, NMT access, and
elements of streetscaping. Bhubaneswar is also creating a low-emission zone around
Lingaraj temple and its surrounding core city areas.
Similar action has started in other non-attainment cities as well. In February
2019, Cuttack, Talcher, Rourkela, Balasore and Angul Municipalities announced
plans to build cycle tracks along the major roads to be completed by March 2024.
Kalinga Nagar has prepared zonal plans to develop an NMT network with a target
to complete by March 2023. Such plans will require dedicated funding and budget.
Several municipalities have proposed NMT networks but these require a roadmap
for implementation.
Most cities and towns of Odisha are compact and that reduces the average daily
travel trips. In fact the average trip length is below 5.5 kilometers. Well organized
intermediate transport, along with good walking and cycling infrastructure can
meet most of the travel demand and convert a sizable share of urban commuting
trips to zero emissions.
6.9. Travel demand management: Parking policy
While scaling up the public transport system and walking and cycling infrastructure
can help in creating safe and accessible public transport services and reduce
dependence on personal vehicles, additional measures are needed for travel demand
management. As a first step, the indicators developed by CPCB for progress reporting
54
on the city ‘s clean air action plan has asked for a parking policy. However, so far
the focus has continued to remain on supply-side management of parking instead
of designing it as a demand management measure to reduce vehicle miles travelled.
In Bhubaneswar, there are 32 on-street and 28 off-street designated parking areas
with a total equivalent car space (ECS) of 5,500. Under the smart city mission, on
street parking on Janpath is under construction.
However, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has prepared a draft parking
policy providing for Parking Management Area Plans (PMAPs) to take an area-
wide approach. This needs to be taken forward to enable municipal ward-wise
PMAPs to demarcate the legal parking areas after considering requirements of
all other street level activities; notify areas where parking cannot be allowed like
parks and green areas, footpaths, traffic intersections, emergency vehicle routes,
etc; introduce variable parking pricing based on duration and user pay principle
to manage demand; impose penalty on illegal parking; ask for proof of parking for
purchase of vehicles; promote shared, priced and public parking to optimize use of
assets; create IT-based parking area management; earmarking of parking revenue
for local area development while meeting the parking requirements of buses and
commercial vehicles. Multi-level parking needs to be decided by the PMAP of an
area and not be a stand-alone project. This approach can improve management
of parking and simultaneously reduce parking demand and vehicle usage. Parking
requirements can be reduced in areas that are well served by public transport.
If the capital region implements bus rapid transit systems, it can additionally adopt
transit oriented development policy to densify development along the bus corridor
so that more people can access the bus routes and enhance walking and cycling
facilities to improve access. This combination can reduce demand for motorized
personal travel.
More steps are needed to restrain personal vehicle usage. As evident from the global
experience, low emissions zones can promote walking, cycling, public transport
usage, clean and zero emissions vehicles while restraining entry of polluting vehicles.
Congestion charges need to be designed and implemented in targeted areas.
6.10 Key strategies for the vehicle and transportation
sector
On-road emissions management
• While strengthening the ongoing programme of Pollution Under Control
Certificate (PUC), advanced emissions monitoring of on-road vehicles needs
55
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
to be done with new generation strategies like remote sensing to control real
world emissions.
• Implement state-wide policy for phasing out of old vehicles and scrappage of
end-of-life vehicles
• Accelerate implementation of electric vehicle policy with a more ambitious
target for the capital region.
• Reduce emissions from heavy duty freight with route realignment and bypasses
to reduce population exposure, augment clean trucks on clean fuels like natural
gas and electricity, reorganise logistics and integrate with railway freight to
increase the modal share of railways state-wide.
Public transport and mobility strategy
• Augment intra-city and inter-city bus transport services and scale up
bus infrastructure along with ITS-based service management, passenger
information systems, fare integration, etc.
• City-wide target for scaling up of the walking and cycling infrastructure and
adoption of street design guidelines for safe access.
• Implement parking policy and ward-wise parking management area plans along
with parking pricing to provide organized legal parking without being in conflict
with other street activities. This is to be designed as a demand management
measure to reduce demand for parking and vehicle miles travelled.
Integration of action points of the LiFE MISSION
The strategy for this sector needs to align with the provision of the LiFE Mission.
Several action points of the Mission pertain to reducing usage of personal
vehicles, augmenting usage of public transport, augmenting walking and cycling
infrastructure, and promoting clean fuels and zero emissions electric mobility.
These include the following LiFE Mission action points:
• Action no 2: Use of public transport wherever possible
• Action no 5: Use bicycles for local or short commute
• Action no 7: Prefer CNG/EVs over petrol and diesel
The LiFE Mission has additionally asked for awareness generation on LiFE
activities, signages for LiFE actions and posting of infographics/audio-visuals in
social media platforms.
The action points of the LiFE Mission have been integrated with the action plan.

7. Construction & Demolition
Waste
As Odisha is urbanizing, construction of buildings and infrastructure is pacing
up. While construction and demolition (C&D) contributes to dust pollution, its
waste also causes considerable environmental damage. While the C&D sites need
stringent dust control management, the waste can also be recycled and reused to
substitute naturally sourced material. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has
already amended rules to allow use of concrete made from recycled material and
processed C&D waste as an alternative to natural aggregates.
While CPCB has issued dust control guidelines from construction sites, the C&D
Rules and Regulations 2016 define the full ambit of C&D waste management.
The urban local bodies are expected to amend the municipal bye-laws accordingly.
Additionally, Swachh Sarvekshan 2021 of MoHUA has accorded more weightage
to waste management infrastructure and waste processing efficiency. This requires
a waste collection system, notified charges for C&D services, segregation of waste
and collection, processing and reuse of waste. This makes the programme more
performance oriented.
This requires comprehensive assessment and quantification of C&D waste generation
from active construction sites and site-wise management plan to indicate disposal
and utilization to plan adequate infrastructure and system for management.
Accordingly, cities and towns need to implement dust control methods, network of
collection points and GPS-enabled transportation systems, recycling facilities, and
strategies for uptake of the recycled products.
There are already established systems of recording all the approved construction
projects of 500 sqm or more on the RERA or EIA portals. Potential generation of
waste can be estimated by using thumb rules such as those developed by TIFAC under
the Department of Science and Technology. All EIA and RERA projects should be
asked to adopt forecasting systems for waste generation and waste management
strategies during the pre-construction stage. While the recycling capacity is being
augmented in the state, it is necessary to encourage sharing of these facilities by a
cluster of towns and cities to maximize asset utilization and to make investments
more efficient. The construction industry needs to be incentivized to manage
their own waste and do onsite reuse and recycling. It is also necessary to integrate
63
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
the informal sector to improve collection efficiency and make the process more
cost effective.
According to the Form VI submitted to OSPCB for the year 2021-22, it was
estimated that a total of 612.309 MT of C&D waste generation was documented for
Odisha across 114 ULBs. Rayagarh that generated 182.5 MT per day topped the list,
followed by Cuttack (170 MT), Junagarh (60 MT), Koraput (50 MT) and Kotpad
(50 MT). According to this report, the remaining ULBs were producing not more
than 10 MT of C&D waste per day. About 74 ULBs were reportedly generating less
than 1 MT of C&D waste per day. The C&D waste produced by five ULBs – Ganjam,
Biramitrapur, Karanjia, Redhakhol, and Athamalik – was not reported. Despite
having populations of 840,834, 309,639, 356,598, and 335,761, Bhubaneswar,
Rourkela, Berhampur, and Sambalpur contributed about 7, 5, 1.5 and 1.5 MT of
C&D waste per day, respectively.
7.1. C&D waste management in non-attainment cities
Bhubaneswar: In May 2016, the State Pollution Control Board of Odisha mandated
(via order No.7617/IND-IV-MSW-141(Pt)) all waste generators and local
authorities to comply with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Rules 2016. According to the Guidelines on Environmental Management of
Construction and Demolition (C&D) Wastes 2017, Bhubaneswar generated about
196.8 TPD of C&D waste in 2016. That has come down over the years. As per form
III submitted by the ULB to the state pollution control board, the municipality
generated 52 TPD construction & demolition waste in 2021, out of which
6–7 tonnes were collected.
An additional assessment of construction projects registered on the Real Estate
Regulatory Authority, Govt. of Odisha (rera.odisha.gov.in) portal has shown that
nearly 46 thousand tonnes of construction waste will be potentially generated from
these projects. There are 215 projects in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation
(BMC) that are registered with RERA.
BMC released the user fees and penalties for various waste related activities in 2015
(via order No. 3078—XXII (L)-53/2013). The order stipulates that the fine for
piling C&D waste materials on public streets is calculated based on their volume:
Rs 1,500 for each tractor trip and Rs 3,000 for each truck trip.
In September 2021, the government had notified the urban local bodies to identify
spots where C&D waste had piled up and issue notice to the owners of the waste
asking them to lift it at their own cost; and in case the owners wanted it to be collected
64
by the ULBs, required fees along with penalty (as per the quantity of waste) would
be charged to the owner. The major violators are bulk generators.
BMC has made it mandatory for architects, builders, developers and contractors
to submit a C&D waste management plan to get the permit for starting any
construction activities. BMC has an on-call collection system for C&D waste in
place. For any construction, renovation and demolition activity, waste generators
can call a toll-free helpline number provided on the BMC’s website to request for
removal of debris.A public grievance portal (https://www.bhubaneswar.me) is
also in place which allows citizens to report and ask for removal of construction
materials and debris.
C&D waste generators which generate 20 tonnes or more in a day or 300 tonnes or
more in a month must submit waste management plans to the ULB before taking
up any construction or demolition activity. For the management of C&D waste,
BMC has four enforcement teams in place
Two landfill sites of 2.48 acres in Pokhariput and 4 acres in Patia are being used for
landfilling of this unprocessed waste.
BMC has a C&D waste processing plant in Pandra, Bhubaneswar (near micro-
composting plants). It started in 2021 with a capacity of 10 TPD. The material is
crushed to form aggregates and used to produce paver blocks. The processing plant
is not yet mechanized, and segregation is done manually by representatives from
a local self-help group and members of Mission Shakti. BMC has floated a tender
for mechanized processing which is expected to be completed by the end of the year
2022. BMC is expanding the recycling capacity of the city. Multiple decentralized
facilities (up to 5 TPD processing capacity) to be managed in partnership with the
Mission Shakti Groups / transgender groups are being envisaged. The members of
Mission Shakti Groups / transgender groups shall collect C&D waste from waste
generators and transport the same to processing facilities. BMC has initiated
procurement of a C&D waste recycling plant. The city has prepared a Request for
Proposal and placed it for approval from the state government.
Cuttack: Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) generated 10 TPD of C&D waste
as per the City Air Action report 2022–23. A notification had been issued for
strict enforcement of CPCB guidelines for construction dust control. About 128
vehicles of various types are available for C&D waste transportation. CMC has also
proposed setting up a C&D waste processing facility with a processing target of
10 TPD.

Angul: Angul municipality generated 14 TPD of C&D waste as per the City Air
Action report 2022–23. The city has three monitoring locations to ensure that
the transportation of construction materials is conducted in covered vehicles.
A notification has been issued for strict enforcement of CPCB guidelines for
construction dust control. The municipality has set aside a separate area for the
disposal of C&D waste generated within its boundary. The municipality has also
proposed a C&D waste processing facility with a processing target of 18 TPD.
The municipality employs two tractor-trailers for transportation of C&D
waste. Currently, the collected C&D waste is used for filling roadside areas or low-
lying areas.
Talcher: The municipality generated 6 TPD of C&D waste as per the City Air Action
report 2022–23. One landfill site of approximately one acre is used for landfilling
of the unprocessed waste. All 21 wards are covered for the collection of C&D
waste. The municipality has provided a separate area for the disposal of C&D waste
generated within its jurisdiction. The municipality has proposed to set up a C&D
waste processing facility. Currently, the collected C&D waste is used for filling low-
lying areas. Every month, two to three inspections are carried out to ensure that the
C&D Waste Rules are being followed. For C&D waste transportation, one truck
and three tractor-trailers are employed.
Balasore: This municipality generated 0.5 TPD of C&D waste as per the City Air
Action report 2022–23. One landfill site at Phulladi, Lumia Jodi Polo (ward no.
31) is used for landfilling of this unprocessed waste. All 31 wards are covered for the
collection of C&D waste. About ten tractor-trailers are employed for transportation
of C&D waste.
Rourkela: This municipality generated 20 TPD of C&D waste out of which 10 tonnes
66
were collected each day, as per the City Air Action report 2022–23. One landfill
site of five acres is used for landfilling of this unprocessed waste. A notification
has been issued (Letter no. 8906, Dt.03.10.2019) to ensure transportation of
construction materials in covered vehicles. Another notification had been issued
(Letter no. 8906, Dt.03.10.2019) for stringent enforcement of CPCB guidelines
for construction dust control. The RMC has also proposed a C&D waste processing
facility with a processing target of 10 TPD. Four truck tippers, two compactors,
ten tractor-trailers, two dumper-placers and three JCBs have been employed for
transportation of C&D waste.
Kalinganagar: This municipality generated 5 TPD of C&D waste, as per the City Air
Action report 2022–23. A notification had been issued to mandate the construction
of a tar road inside the construction site for the movement of vehicles carrying
construction material. Ten officers have been deployed for regular inspections
of construction sites and to restrict storage of construction materials along the
road. The municipality also issued a notification for strict enforcement of CPCB
guidelines for construction dust control (use of green screens, side covering of
digging sites, etc.).
7.2. Dust control in construction sites
The CPCB issued guidelines for dust management and control in 2018. This will
require stringent surveillance to ensure proper and effective implementation
and adoption of appropriate technologies and strategies for dust control. Dust
mitigation measures can be further strengthened. Standards/guidelines related to
C&D waste and road dust management have been adopted by the municipalities.
As is practiced in other states, a web portal may be launched for C&D sites of 500
sqm and above plot areas for uploading of self-audits of dust pollution control. This
may include registration, uploading of self-declaration, generation data for physical
audit and the physical audit for compliance reporting. Stringent enforcement of
dust control measures, adoption of appropriate technical methods, monitoring and
compliance is necessary in all municipalities.
Moreover, construction agencies need to renew their fleet of construction machinery
to meet the current BS IV emissions standards notified by MoRTH in 2021. The BS
VI standards are due for implementation in 2024.
7.3. Key strategies for action

8. Waste management to
control open burning of
municipal solid waste and
landfill fires
Open burning of waste and spontaneous fires in landfills contribute substantially
to air pollution and cause high toxic exposure for local communities. This can
be resolved only with comprehensive and effective waste management practices.
This requires proper quantification of waste generation, adequately planned
infrastructure for 100 per cent segregated waste collection, transfer and material
recovery through recycling, and stopping fresh dumping of waste in landfills along
with complete remediation of legacy waste. This strategy is a central focus of the
LiFE Mission.

Map 2: Total municipal solid waste generated in Odisha: ULB-wise
Map 3: Per capita solid waste generated in Odisha: ULB-wise
74
The 114 ULBs of Odisha generate 2,130 TPD of municipal solid waste according to
the Form IV submitted to the OSPCB for 2021-22. Top generators are Bhubaneswar
(520 TPD), Cuttack (200 TPD), Berhampur (143 TPD), Sambalpur (110 TPD) and
Rourkela (102 TPD). These five cities are responsible for generating about half of
the state’s municipal solid waste.
8.1. Collection efficiency
Of the 114 ULBs, 84 have reported 100 per cent collection of the generated waste.
This includes all Class 1 cities and the collection is done door-to-door. Remaining
cities have more than 70 per cent collection except Phulbani (53 per cent),
Jagatsinghpur (68 per cent), Kotpad (67 per cent), Athamallick (63 per cent), G
Udayagiri (63 per cent), Daspala (30 per cent) and Odagaon (44 per cent).

Segregation: While almost all the ULBs have reported complete segregation of
waste, seven ULBs – Jatani, Anadapur, Aska, Buguda, Balimela, Athamallik and
Atabira – have reported they have yet to improve segregation practices in the city.
Processing/Treatment: According to the Form IV data compiled by OSPCB,
Odisha is treating 64 per cent of the waste generated in the state. About 57 ULBs
are treating 100 per cent of their waste generated, while 18 ULBs are treating less
than 50 per cent of their waste.
Among the Class 1 cities, Berhampur, Balasore and Puri are treating 100 per cent of
their waste. Other than this, 29 ULBs have a sanitary landfill. 62 ULBs do not have
any proposal for improvement of solid waste management in their city according to
the report. Cuttack is among these cities.

8.2. Plastic waste management: All ULBs
According to Form V submitted to the OSPCB for 2021-22, 111.49 tonnes of plastic
waste is produced daily throughout 114 ULBs. All the ULBs had published draft
bye-laws, but it would be preferable to have a final version that could be adhered to.
According to the report, the state’s total plastic waste generation for 2021–22 was
40,696.43 TPA, but only 19.39 per cent of it was channelized for use. More than half
of the ULBs (64) failed to report the quantity of plastic waste being channelized.
Bhubaneswar reported the highest plastic waste generation during the year 2021–
22, i.e., 13,096 TPA, followed by Cuttack (5,475 TPA), Paradeep (3,124 TPA),
Balasore (2,248 TPA), Rourkela (2,160 TPA), Berhampur (1,710 TPA), Dhenkanal
(1,440 TPA), Kantabanji (1,252 TPA), Dharamgarh (1,108 TPA) and Ranpur
(1,095 TPA). All other ULBs had relatively lower plastic waste generation, with
Bellaguntha, Kotpad and Surada having as low as zero TPA. Less than one TPA
of plastic waste was reported to have been produced in the ULBs of Rayagada
(0.014 TPA), Balimela (0.05 TPA), Rambha (0.08 TPA), Nimapara (0.23 TPA),
Pipli (0.24 TPA), Jaleswar (0.45 TPA), Gudari (0.45 TPA), Athamallik (0.52 TPA),
Redhakhol (0.6 TPA), Bijepur (0.75 TPA), and Umerkote (0.8 TPA). Despite
having huge populations of 335,761, 109,743 and 142,864, Sambalpur, Baripada,
and Bhadrak were found to only produce 35, 30 and 10 TPA of plastic garbage,
respectively.
Balasore (2,248 TPA) was stated to have the most plastic waste that was channelled
for use, followed by Bhubaneswar (1,673 TPA) and Dharamgarh (1,108 TPA).
According to the report, the ULBs of Balasore, Dharamgarh, Nuapada, Ganjam,
Khalikote, Kesinga, Balliguda and Phulbani were identified to be the most effective
processing, with all plastic waste produced being channelized (100 per cent) for
usage. Rajgangpur (96.77 per cent), Bargarh (91.67 per cent), Puri (88.89 per
cent), Padampur (88.89 per cent), Kodala (84.62 per cent), Barbil (72.22 per cent),
Soro (66.67 per cent) and Keonjhargarh (60.00 per cent) were reported to have
more than 50 per cent of the waste being channelled for usage. While, there was no
channelisation of plastic waste (0 per cent) stated for Balugaon, Banpur, Chikiti,
Khandapada, Choudwar, Paralakhemundi, Attabira, Anandapur, Vyasanagar,
Kabisurya Nagar, Bhadrak, Dhmnagar, Purshottampur, Chandbali, Bhanjanagar,

8.3. Status of non-attainment cities: Municipal solid
waste
Bhubaneswar: As per census 2011, Bhubaneswar has a population of 840,834 in
67 wards. The city generates 520 TPD of solid waste, of which 255 TPD (49 per
cent) is processed and 265 TPD (51 per cent) is disposed of at the dumpsite. The
city has one legacy waste landfill site located in Daruthenga. The sanitary inspectors
conduct routine checks and inspections in 67 wards of Bhubaneswar Municipal
Corporation, and women’s self-help groups (WSHGs) promote the necessary
awareness. There is no evidence that biomass, crop residue, waste, leaves or other
materials have been burned within the BMC’s boundary.

Operations: According to the Form IV (annual report format) of Solid Waste
Management Rules 2016 submitted by BMC to OSPCB for 2021-22, all buildings
in Bhubaneswar are segregating and storing their solid waste at source. As per the
report, all households are covered under door-to-door collection. 80 per cent of
the collection is done through motorized vehicles, 10 per cent using containerized
tricycles/handcarts and remaining 10 per cent though battery operated vehicles.
Infrastructure: BMC has a solid waste storage capacity of 480.7 cum comprising
437 bins of volume 1.1 cum. All solid waste generated in Bhubaneswar is transported
everyday using 382 vehicles of different types and capacities and making 771 trips
(see Table 8: Solid waste transportation infrastructure in Bhubaneswar).

BMC has already adopted the decentralized solid waste management system
through micro-composting processing plants, material recovery facility plants, and
a bio-methanation unit. BMC has proposed 43 decentralized micro-composting
processing plants to treat wet waste and 26 decentralized material recovery facility
processing units for dry waste management and recycling. It has established micro
composting centres (MCC) with a combined treatment capacity of 255 TPD till
date. Treatment capacity of 220 TPD is under construction as per the annual report
submitted by BMC. In 2021-22, these MCCs produced 5,256 tonnes of compost
of which nearly 48.7 tonnes were sold. BMC plans to use composting to treat their
entire wet solid waste and material recovery facility for dry waste.
The city has one landfill site spread across an area of 61.48 acres. This site is in close
proximity to an eco-sensitive area (Nandankan zoo) and has adjoining water bodies.
There is a need to either remediate this site or install environmental safeguards at
the site such as green belts, base lining, methane collectors among others. Biomining
or legacy waste remediation was unable to begin at Bhuasuni Dumping Yard due
to local agitation from Daruthenga villagers. A total of 1,584,400 metric tonnes of
legacy waste at Bhuasuni dumping yard need to be remediated. Two fire engines are
constantly available at the Bhuasuni dumping yard to douse the spontaneous fires
that occur throughout the year.
Bhubaneswar: Plastic waste management
According to the Form V (annual report format) of Plastic Waste Management
(Amendment) Rules, 2018 submitted by BMC to OSPCB for 2021-22, 675 rag
pickers are involved in the mechanism of segregating plastic waste from municipal
solid waste. 1,673 TPA of plastic waste was collected in a year and the same was
channelized for recycling.
82
Currently, Bhubaneswar municipality is operating a (partnership between BMC-
UNDP AND HCCB) Plastic Waste management project “Prithvi” Swachhata
Kendra (plastic recycling plant located at Sainik school). All kinds of plastic waste
collected from wards, commercial areas, shopping complexes, malls, etc. are sorted,
segregated, cleaned and baled in baling machines. It is then further sent to the
registered recyclers selected by BMC through a tender process. The municipality
has tied up with seven NGO partners for door-to-door collection and segregation
of waste and is operating ten MRF’s at different locations with a combined capacity
of managing 100 TPD of solid waste (including plastic waste). The municipality
seized 1.6 MT of banned single-use plastics and imposed a fine of Rs 789,950 from
January 2021 to December 2021 from different defaulters.
Cuttack: Solid waste management
Cuttack has an area of 192.5 sq. km, population of 610,189 and 59 wards. The city
generates 200 TPD of solid waste, all of which is collected and 30 TPD is processed.
There are 24 identified bulk generators.

ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Operations: According to the Form IV (annual report format) of Solid Waste
Management Rules 2016 submitted by CMC to OSPCB for 2021-22, 62.5 per cent
premises in Cuttack are segregating their solid waste at source. As per the report, 59
(100 per cent) wards are covered under door-to-door collection. 50 per cent of the
collection is done through motorized vehicles and 40 per cent using containerized
tricycles/handcarts.
Infrastructure: CMC has 147 open waste storage sites, 90 bins upto 1.1 cum, 1,100
bins upto 0.6 cum and 107 bins of 3.5 cum. The total capacity of waste storage is 759
cum. CMC has composting cum gardening site and proposes two recycling facilities
for the processing of dry waste. The composting cum gardening site is selling the
compost to the line departments (forestry, watershed, agriculture and farming) and
local people.
Cuttack has 184 vehicles for transportation (including JCB, loader, excavators, etc.)
of solid waste (see Table 9: Solid waste transportation infrastructure in Cuttack).
170 TPD of waste is transported daily which is 92 per cent of the total waste. 30 MT
of raw materials is processed for composting daily and 0.65MT of final product is
produced.

8.4. Need effective leveraging of Swachh Bharat
Mission Urban 2.0
Clean air action needs to leverage Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 (SBM 2.0) that
has mandated remediation of legacy dumpsite through bio-mining, enforcement
and incentivization for segregation through extensive bye-laws, augmentation of
capacity for treatment-processing-recycle-recovery to meet existing and projected
92
Map 17: Location of Kalinga Nagar (Source: Based on the data of Odisha Geo
portal; Generated by CSE)
generation of municipal solid waste and divert maximum waste from reaching the
landfill. The ULBs are mandated to reduce landfilling of solid waste to a maximum of
20 per cent by 2025. This is to be achieved through 100 per cent source segregation
(wet and dry, including domestic hazardous and sanitary waste); 100 per cent door-
to-door collection of segregated waste from each household; 100 per cent scientific
management of all fraction of waste; moving towards a minimal use of single-use
plastics; and digital tracking and monitoring of waste management operations.
This further requires integration of the informal sector, performance monitoring
and real-time tracking of services. The focus is also on phased reduction in single-
use plastic. Time-bound implementation of SBM 2.0 would minimize the problem
of waste burning.
Dedicated funding is available for waste management and the ULBs can avail
performance-linked Additional Central Assistance (ACA) for managing legacy
waste and creating additional treatment. Disbursement of ACA requires cities with
93
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
less than 10 lakh population to complete bio-remediation by March 2023 and cities
with more than 10 lakh population, by March 2024. The funding requires creation
of additional facilities for treatment and waste management performance. If cities
do not achieve at least 60 per cent segregation by 2023, cities would not be entitled
to receive further additional central assistance.
8.5. Key strategies of SBM 2.0
• Divert and prevent fresh wet (bio-degradable) waste from reaching the
dumpsites. Adopt decentralized model in collaboration with private agencies in
PPP mode
• Remediation of legacy dumpsite as per the requirements of SBM 2.0 timeline
• For segregation of waste, collect wet waste daily and designate days for collection
of dry and other streams of non-recyclable waste
• Incentivize source segregation through property tax rebate
• Map bulk waste generators and enforce in-situ management
• Set up material recovery facility-cum-micro composting site and engage
informal sector to channelize recyclables to the local level aggregators.
• Scientific landfill to be used only for a negligible amount of residual wastes
(rejects)
• Redesign concessionaire agreement to pay on the basis of treated quantity
• Create a business model around the waste ecosystem to ensure maximum
resource recovery. For example, bio-CNG plant based on segregated wet waste
can augment annual revenue of the municipalities.
Integrate LiFE Mission measures:
The action points of the LiFE Mission that have strong bearing on waste management
and air quality are as follows:
Action no 39: Prefer non-plastic eco-friendly cutlery during gatherings and events
Action no 42: Use recycled plastic over virgin plastic, wherever possible
Action no 47: Compost food waste at home
Action no 52: Contribute cattle waste, food waste and agricultural waste to biogas
plan (provided under GOBARdhan)
Action no 53: Practice segregation of dry and wet waste at homes
Action no 61: Do not discard waste in water bodies and in public spaces
Action no 73: Discard gadgets in nearest e-recycling units
The LiFE Mission has asked for awareness generation on LiFE activities, signages for
LiFE actions and posting of infographics/ audio visuals on social media platforms.

9. Crop residue burning and
forest fires
There are two types of episodic pollution events that are associated with crop residue
burning and forest fires. Both can contribute significantly to local and regional air
quality.
Crop residues are burnt during the time of harvests and are not a perennial issue. Smaller
stubble left on the ground after harvesting is expensive to remove and therefore burning
of residues is the easiest way for disposal. Agro-residue or crop residues are of different
sizes and densities that include straw, stalks, leaves, fibrous materials, etc. Odisha is
largely a paddy growing state and the waste-straw is mostly used as a cattle-feed. Cases
of stubble burning in the state are also far and few.
At a regional scale, air quality is also impacted by the forest fires which are seasonal. In
Odisha, forest fires are more common in summer season (see Map 18: Forest fire counts
in Orissa in summer, 2022 and Map 19: Forest fire counts in Orissa in winter, 2022).
The agriculture department of Odisha works to manage the stubble burning and forest
fires. Both the problem will require different strategies for control.
To prevent the problem of crop residue burning, both ex-situ and in-situ measures are
needed. As part of the ex-situ measures, it is necessary to map out the end uses of the
biomass as cattle feed, biomass fuel for industry, co-firing in power plants and other
value added production from biomass like biogas, bio-CNG, etc. This can not only help
to build market value for the waste residues but also ensure more efficient material
recovery. This will require efficient collection and transportation systems to build the
supply chain of biomass to link with the market. This will require support for balers,
and storage and transport.
The in-situ measures will require harvesting and seeding machineries that can help
to mix the stubble or straw with the soil and mulch it for fertilisation. Also the use of
decomposers can accelerate decomposing of biomass in the field and reduce the time
for disposal. Given the national trend of growing incidence of crop residue burning, a
preventive action plan will be helpful.
Forest department will need to strengthen the strategies for control and dousing of
forest fires as per the defined methods and techniques.

10. Household emissions
Household air pollution due to widespread use of solid fuels can be responsible
for significant share of outdoor air pollution. This requires rapid energy transition
to replace solid fuels in both urban and rural households with cleaner fuels. Even
though there has been substantial expansion of LPG connection and piped natural
gas (PNG) network in the region, the problem remains. Central government
schemes including Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and direct benefit
transfer to LPG consumers (PAHAL) combined with state government initiatives
has widened the coverage.
Low-income groups often do not have adequate access to reliable supply of
affordable clean fuels. Expansion of PNG and LPG and electric cooking can help
to improve access. Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched on 1
May 2016 to distribute 50 million LPG connections to families which fall below the
poverty line. PMUY 2.0 to offer 1 crore more LPG connections. The same is under
implementation. Under PMUY, the total LPG domestic consumers (till 2021) are
22,819,027 in Odisha.
Details of the implementation are as follows:
• PMUY connection issued (till 2021) = 8,886,588
• Households using LPG as cooking fuels under PMUY= 39%
(MOPNG, 2020-21, Page No. 59 and 61- Annexure VIII)
• Under PMUY – District-wise total LPG connection released= 11,685,031
(Annexure IX)
It is also necessary to promote induction cooking in all households, This has better
thermal efficiency, and comparable cost effectiveness. It is also necessary to address
use of solid fuels in open eateries and restaurants. This can be further aided by the
adoption of indoor air quality standards/guidelines.
OSPCB has already issued the approved fuel list to mandate use of only clean fuels
in open eateries, resturaunts and hotels and include this in permit condition, as
applicable. The commercial licenses for setting up of these eateries need to be linked
with a mandate for clean fuel.
112
Key strategies for curbing use of solid fuels for cooking
• Aim for 100 per cent coverage of households in all districts for clean cooking
fuels
• Enforce ban on use of coal and other dirty fuels in open eateries
• Link up decentralized renewable energy generation with clean energy access.
• Adopt indoor air quality standards/guidelines

11. Road dust and urban
greening
Road dust is a significant contributor to coarse particles and its share increases
during summer. This is also influenced by the local geo-climatic conditions and
loose crustal soil and high wind effect. Re-suspension of road dust due to vehicular
traffic is of special concern. Dust is a carrier of toxins from combustion sources and
therefore can be harmful.
In addition to road cleaning, sweeping and water sprinkling that most municipalities
do, it is necessary to address mismanaged urban construction of roads, lack of
paving and urban greening together. This requires implementation of street design
guidelines for footpaths with adequate vegetative buffers and paving of roads;
blacktopping and pavement of road shoulders, maintenance of pothole free roads;
implementation of truck loading guidelines; use of appropriate enclosures for haul
trucks; gravel paving for all freight routes; increase in green cover on the road sides;
and enforcement of air pollution control in concrete batching (use of water spray
and wind breakers, bag filters at silos and enclosures, hoods, curtains, etc).
Currently, the urban local bodies in Odisha are more focused on the maintenance of
roads, mechanical and manual sweeping, and water sprinkling.
In Bhubaneswar, a total length of 2,140 km is cleaned using mechanical sweepers (60
per cent) and remaining by manual sweeping (40 per cent). Street sweeping is done
every day in the city. Currently, two mechanical sweepers are operational through
outsourcing, and a proposal for two mechanical sweepers has been submitted for
procurement through e-tender. A total of nine parks have been constructed with an
expenditure of Rs 3.60 crore.
In Cuttack, CMC has identified 10 km road stretches with high dust generation.
Sweeping of streets happens for a total length of 860.57 km, however the mode is not
specified. 90 per cent of the roads are swept every day, while 8 per cent are swept on
alternate days. Remaining 2 per cent of the roads are swept only twice a week.
In Angul, a total of 1.80 km of road is paved from wall to wall. End-to-end paving
was done for 2.5 km under the TAMDA fund in FY 2020–21. Angul municipality
proposed one water fountain at a major traffic intersection after the identification of
114
a total of nine traffic junctions. In the city, pedestrian pathways have been provided
along major roads. New pedestrian pathways are being constructed in wards 14 and
22 along a 6-kilometer stretch of the 10-kilometer road.
In Angul, 5 per cent of the total road is repaired every year. In the municipality, a
total of 3 km of road length is paved and maintained. There are a total of six major
traffic junctions identified and two road stretches (Bus Stand to Talbeda and Bus
Stand to Pabitra Mohan Chhak) with high dust generation. However, no fountain
has yet been proposed by the municipality for 2022–203. Talcher Municipality has
planted trees to increase green cover of the city.
Angul Municipality has planted 2,098 trees, accounting for approximately 65 per
cent of its annual green cover target. The municipality also issued a notice requiring
builders to leave 25-33 per cent of their land for green belts in residential colonies.
In Balasore, majority of road sweeping in the city of a total length of 471 km is
done on a daily basis using manual sweeping. Forty regular sweepers are employed
for sweeping of main roads. One mechanical sweeper is required, which will be
procured by the 2022-23 financial year, as reported by Balasore Municipality.
The municipality also procured one water sprinkler to suppress road dust. The
municipality also proposed two water fountains at major traffic junctions. The
municipality takes actions to upgrade infrastructure and reduce congestion. All
solid waste generated in Balasore is transported everyday using 10 tractors, 54
battery-operated vehicles and 199 wheel barrows.
In Rourkela, the city has a total length of 470.67 km of roads that are cleaned with
mechanical sweepers (75 per cent) and manual sweeping (25 per cent). 70 per cent
of the roads are swept every day, while 20 per cent are swept on alternate days.
Remaining 10 per cent of the roads are swept only twice a week. A total of 42 km
road widening master plan is being prepared by RMC to reduce traffic congestion.
The municipal corporation has procured one water sprinkler to suppress road
dust. The municipality also proposed 23 water fountains at major traffic junctions.
The municipality takes actions to upgrade infrastructure and reduce congestion.
RMC has planted 200 trees for increasing green cover. Mandatory conditions are
imposed on builders for providing at least 40 per cent green cover during the grant
of environmental clearance and consent to establish.
In Kalinganagar majority of road sweeping in the city is done on a daily basis using
manual sweeping. The municipality proposed 100 per cent brick lining, paving,
and plantation of roads along the canals and nalas within the city boundary. The
115
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
municipality has planted trees for increasing green cover in seven locations in a
1.5-acre area. The municipality has imposed mandatory conditions on builders
for providing at least 33 per cent green cover during the grant of environmental
clearance and consent to establish.
Key strategies for road dust control and urban greening
• Municipal ward-wise street network redevelopment plans for paving and
greening as per IRC guidelines, without impeding the needs of other road users
including pedestrians.
• Hotspot action for road cleaning with GPS-enabled mechanical sweepers;
desilting of canals/nullah’s; brick lining of side roads; dedicated helpline with
MIS support; and citizen interface to enable geo-tagging for complaints.
• Urban greening agenda with greening of open areas, urban forestry, plantation
for green walling and protection of all forest areas to act as sink. Align with
afforestation and plantation programmes of the forest department.

12. Institutional framework
and funding strategy
State-wide implementation of clean air action plan will require strong and
integrated institutional framework and institutional processes and systems. Already
the government of Odisha has put in place the following institutional framework
for monitoring of the implementation of clean air plans.
• Steering committee
• State-level monitoring and implementation committee
• District-level implementation committee
In addition to the state-level committee, city-level air quality management cells
have also been formed to undertake activities in line with the NCAP guidelines.
This framework will need to facilitate more aligned and harmonized action with
strong accountability and transparent monitoring for compliance across all
concerned departments for implementation of this multi-sector plan.
For each sector, specific schemes and programmes will have to be identified or
devised to enable implementation of the priority strategies and indicators included
in the state plan.
Simultaneously, the plan needs to leverage the other relevant programmes and
schemes (both central and state) for effective leveraging of different lines of funding
and programmes to deliver on clean air objectives. These include SBM 2.0, Amrut,
Smart City Programme, bus funding, FAME II programme, etc.
Pollution control policies and regulations have evolved considerably to set the
regulatory standards, compliance strategy and deterrence frameworks in each
sector – industry and power plants, waste streams, vehicles and transport among
others. This needs to be fully leveraged for implementation and compliance.
All Programme Monitoring Units or Air Pollution Cells require strong monitoring
methods, standard operating procedures, management information system
and data protocol for tracking compliance against targets, defining the scope
of the programme, protocol for data recording for targeted strategies within
each department, etc. This requires adequate detailing of scope of action at the
departmental level.
119
ODISHA STATE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN
Action needs to be measurable and verifiable to be able to meet the clean air targets
and the NAAQS at the end of the plan period.
Strengthen institutional, regulatory and technical capacity of the departments to
enable planning and implementation of clean air programme.
Funding strategies: The state of Odisha has received funds under the NCAP for the
non-attainment cities. From 2022 onwards the funding under NCAP and also from
XV Finance Commission have become performance-based supplemental grant to
address a critical gap in plans (see Table 12: Funds allocation under NCAP).
As per the office memorandum of MoEFCC, sanction of funds under NCAP for
the next financial year are linked to achievement of targets provided under the
Mission LiFE components. This will be included in PRANA portal for reporting
and monitoring progress. The components identified for implementation include
public transport, cycling and walking, CNG and electric vehicles, reducing use of
consumer plastic products, use of recycled plastic over virgin plastic, composting of
food waste at home, biogas plan from cattle waste, food waste and agricultural waste,
segregation of dry and wet waste at homes, no waste dumping in water bodies and
in public spaces, tree plantation, and discarding gadgets in nearest e-recycling units.

Funding strategies in all sectors need to be consistent with the objective of clean
air action. Align the objectives of multiple funding schemes and programmes in
different sectors to maximize gains. Specific funding instruments are already
available in different sectors that can be aligned like SBM2.0, FAME II, spending
on infrastructure, among others.
120
The central and state government schemes and budget may be further supported
with innovative fiscal instruments to generate additional revenue and make subsidies
and incentives more revenue neutral. Market-based instruments may be explored
to incentivize industrial and private sector investments in pollution control.
Million-plus cities Challenge Fund (MCF), based on a tripartite Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between MoEFCC, the state government and the concerned
ULB, needs a year-wise action plan. Responsibility of the nodal entity will be to
achieve performance based on a range of criteria. These include strengthening of
pollution monitoring mechanism; source-wise cause analysis for air pollution;
progress on action plans and compliance with statutory guidelines; quantification
and evaluation of air quality improvements; reduction in air pollution level
(particulate matter) and frequency of exceedance in AQI levels.
These parameters have been weighted and linked with performance for the release
of grants. SBM 2.0 grant for waste management is also performance linked. Thus,
defining the scope of action and strategy for implementation in each sector and
verifiable improvement in air quality becomes critical to maximize air quality gains.

RESEARCH PAPER
Health Damages from Air Pollution: Evidence from
Opencast Coal Mining Region of Odisha, India
Tapaswini Nayak  and Indrani Roy Chowdhury 
Abstract: The present study examines the productive day‘s loss of local
communities in the opencast coal mining region of Angul (Talcher) district in
Odisha, due to respiratory illness, by using the dose-response function model. The
productive day‘s loss is estimated in terms of restricted activities or work days lost,
due to severe respiratory illness (RI), induced by air pollution. Health diaries are
analyzed through the seasonal household survey to predict the likelihood of RI-
related sickness (in terms of the restricted days) of the residents of the mining
region (due to air pollution). Poisson and negative binomial regression are fitted for
the purpose of count data analysis. The regression result confirms that there is a
positive and significant relationship between the level of air pollution (respiratory
suspended particulate matter (RSPM)/particulate matter less than 10 g/m3(PM10)
and RI-related sick days, depicting that a reduction in air pollution level (PM10)
may cause a reduction in expected number of RI-related sick days in the coal
mining region. Further monetary welfare gain from avoiding the RI-related sick
days are estimated for the population of Talcher coal mining area, Odisha.
Keywords: Air pollution; respiratory illness; health diaries; dose-response function;
count data regression.

poor education. This is the well-documented ‘resource curse‘ or ‗paradox of
plenty‘ (Sachs and Warner 1997, 2001). Balancing efficient utilization of
mineral resources with ensuring equitable and sustainable development and
safeguarding the local environment and societal well-being is often a
challenge.

million tons)

In the post-liberalization period, many Indian states are encountering a
voracious appetite for energy and infrastructure. The intense interstate
competitions trigger the demand for energy and infrastructure, which is
needed to attract investment to boost growth. This appetite has led to the
rampant extraction and utilization of mineral resources in these states.
Mining activities are often accompanied by a drastic jump in mineral rich
pollution load (both air and water pollution), widespread soil degradation
and forest cover loss (State of Environment Report 2008; David Stuligross
1999).
The state of Odisha is mineral-rich. In the post-reform period, Odisha and
other mineral-rich states have been struggling to answer a difficult question:
should they intensify their extraction of mineral resources in their quest for
a high rate of growth at the cost of their environment?
Odisha is blessed with an abundance of mineral reserves — 24 per cent of
India‘s coal reserves, 17 per cent of iron ore, 98 per cent of chromite, 51
per cent of bauxite, 35 per cent of manganese, and 92 per cent of nickel ore
(Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15). The state has the second largest
reserve of coal in India. The share of mining in Odisha‘s gross state
domestic product (GSDP) has escalated significantly to 7 per cent of GSDP
in 2014–15 (Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15). The state ranks first in
[45] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
country in terms of value of coal reserves and extraction. The state has
witnessed an unprecedented increase in coal production from 8 million tons
in 2003–04 to 60 million tons in 2013–14. Figures 1 and 2 depict the
production recent growth trends of major mineral resources in Odisha.
Coal alone accounted for 70 per cent

Minerals in Odisha, 2013-14 (in Rs.

lakh)
(Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15).
Odisha is one of the richest
biodiversity regions in South-East Asia
(State of the Environment Report
Odisha 2007). In terms of mineral
deposits and production, the state
occupies a vital position in the country
(Murthy and Rao 2006; Economic
Survey of Odisha 2014–15). The
Source: Odisha Economic survey,
strong performance of the mining
2014-15
sector in terms of both production and
value has thus resulted in a significant growth of the state‘s average GSDP
(Economic Survey of Odisha 2014–15). The investment share of the mining
sector in total outstanding investments makes Odisha the fifteenth highest
recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) among all Indian states. The
mining revenue receipt has been steadily increasing over the past decade
(Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15).
A report by the State of Environment (2008) has declared all the coal belts
of the state most unsafe for human health and living conditions. The
neighbourhood of the coal belt witnesses alarmingly high concentration of
suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RPM)
exceeding the national standard level by several folds. Moreover, WHO
(2002) suggests that coal mining process which release toxic pollutants can
adversely affect the air quality in the surrounding environment.
Coal is an important source of fuel and power and is therefore critically
important for the growth and development of a transition economy like
Odisha‘s. Moreover, coal has the highest forward linkage with a number of
other industries. Therefore, extraction of coal is an attractive option for a
state for the creation of direct and indirect employment opportunities,
foreign exchange earnings through FDI, generation of mineral royalties, tax
revenues, etc. However, coal production is treated as ‗dirty industry‘ as it is
the most polluting natural resource (Elizabeth and York 2012; Michelle
2014). Apart from the direct impact of the occupational hazards of the coal
miners, coal mining activities, particularly open cast coal mining, imposes
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [46]
highly negative environmental externalities (through air pollution, water
pollution, contamination and loss of fertility of land, and forest loss and
degradation) and health externalities (in terms of poor quality of health
among the local communities, living in the proximity of opencast coal
mining region). Mining and extraction activities create irreversible damages
to the local environment, having long-run future consequences. From
mining to combustion of coal, all the intervening processes release various
toxic pollutants (such as RSPM (PM )), carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide (SO )
10 2
which adversely affect the air quality in the surrounding environment
(WHO 2002). These huge amounts of wastages and pollutants (along with
fly ash, coal dust, and heat) have dangerous health impact for the human
beings living in the neighbourhood. Thus, from the policy perspective, or
for state planning, it poses a serious challenge, in terms of a trade-off
between the overall growth and development of the state vis-a-vis
environmental degradation and health concerns of the local communities.
Given the economic importance of coal, for a state like Odisha, forgoing
the mineral extraction activities implies forgoing immediate opportunities
for the entire state seems exorbitantly costly at the present stage of its
development. As a consequence, the environment and health concerns of
local communities in the mining region remain on the back burner.
Opencast coal mining leads to more severe air pollution than underground
mining (Ghose and Banerjee 1995). All the mining processes, starting from
drilling to transportation and screening, are the major sources of such
emissions (Pathak et al. 2007). Air pollution in opencast coal mines is mainly
due to the toxic emission of particulate matter and gases including methane,
sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. These air pollutants reduce air
quality and ultimately affect people around mining areas (Nanda and Tiwari
2001). The major air pollutants produced by opencast coal mining are SPM
and RPM (Sinha and Banerjee 1997; CMRI 1998). Mine fire is also
considered as a major source of air pollution in some of the coalfields. The
problems may have local, regional, and global impacts. Dust generated by
opencast coal mining also affects agricultural productivity (Mishra 2008).
Several research findings (Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010) show
high concentrations of lower atmospheric pollution, especially
RSPM(PM ), adversely contribute to human morbidity, increase respiratory
10
syndromes, and reduce lung functions. Longer term exposure to air
pollution (PM ) may lead to irritation, asthma, high blood pressure and
10
heart diseases (Pope et al. 1995, 2007). High concentration of RSPM
increase respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and bronchial cases,
while gaseous emissions contribute towards global warming, acid rain, and
ground-level ozone besides causing health hazards to the exposed
[47] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
population (Pathak et al. 2007). Therefore, health risk and morbidity due to
air pollution is high where opencast coal mining is predominant. Pattanayak
et al. (2011) also observe that in Keonjhar, Odisha, local communities are
vulnerable to diseases such as acute respiratory illness (RI), gastric,
tuberculosis, and skin diseases, due to high exposure to toxic elements. All
these health problems no doubt have economic costs arising from the
expenses incurred in treating the diseases and productive days lost (Ostro
1994; Banerjee 2001).
Traditionally, opportunity costs of human health was interpreted solely on
account of the individual‘s physical well-being without considering the
environmental and social backgrounds around him (Rapport and Mergler
2004). From the 1970s, there has been a departure from the traditional
belief, and ‗health‘ is recognized as a precious asset in itself and an
absolutely essential ingredient for human development and productivity
(Grossman 1972). Good health with mental well-being is termed both a
‗resource‘ and ‗means‘ for stimulating economic development, and an
outcome of economic development (Brundtland 2002); the WHO (2005)
argues that ‗quality of health‘ is related not only to freedom from diseases
but also associated with a healthy and hygienic environment.
Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the linkages between health and
the environment in the opencast coal mining area in Angul district of
Odisha. This linkage paves the pathway for the significance of
environmental quality in determining the quality of health and well-being.
Given the enormous economic cost involved in terms of productive days
lost and treatment of RI-related diseases caused by coal-mining activity, it is
critically important to estimate the health impact of air pollution in the
opencast coal mining region.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section
3 explains the dose-response methodology that depicts the association
between human health and air pollution. Section 4 presents the household
survey design. Section 5 describes the econometric methodology. Section 6
presents the empirical estimation of RI-related sick days and discusses the
regression results. Section 7 discusses the evaluation of the welfare gain of
air pollution reduction. Finally, Section 8 presents the main findings and
conclusions.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The seminal work by Grossman (1972) pioneered the formulation of a
theoretical model of household production function. He analyses the
demand for health by developing human capital model, where he suggests
‗health‘ as a durable human capital stock and medical care as an important
factor in its production. Cropper (1981) added pollution as a crucial
ingredient and calculated the health damage reduction from the reduction in
the air pollution level. Ostro (1994) suggests the a three-step method of
calculating the health benefits of reducing air pollution. The first is to find
out the dose-response relationship that shows the health outcome of air
pollution. The second is to set the target group population, who are
victimized, and exposed to the specific air pollution effect. The third is to
calculate the change in air pollution level by implementing a specific
pollution-reducing technique.
The more recent studies have attempted to explore a relationship between
air pollution and the occurrence of illness by using dose-response and
damage functions, while some economists have calculated the health
damage cost of air pollution levels using one of three methods: cost-of-
illness (COI), dose-response, and contingency valuation (Alberini et al. 1997;
Ostro 1994; Krupanik 2000). In the case of South Asia, Murty et al. (2003)
and Gupta (2008) calculated the health benefits from the reduction in urban
air pollution level in the Indian states. Mishra (2012) estimated the damage
to human health and agricultural productivity loss from pollution induced
by coal-mining activities in Odisha. Chaulya (2003) shows that the annual
average SPM and RSPM (PM ) concentration in the Ib valley coalfield of
10
Odisha exceeds the standards set in the Indian National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) protocol for both residential and industrial
areas. The problem is not limited to these areas alone; air ambient quality is
critical in the state‘s entire mining belt.
The literature on estimating the morbidity and health impact costs are
mostly confined to urban air pollution, vehicular pollution, etc. There are
some studies on the health impact of air pollution in the cement industry
(Bogahawatte 2008) and iron mining (Pattanayak et al. 2011), and of the
occupational hazards (i.e., direct impact) of coal mining (Sarkar et al. 2004),
but there are only a few studies to the best of our knowledge on the health
impact of air pollution induced by opencast coal mining in Odisha (Mishra
2012; Singh et al. 2010; Hota and Mishra 2010). Most studies address the
health concerns from air pollution and the pollution load in coal mining
areas, but they do not address many important questions.
[49] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
Therefore, this study tries to bridge the research gap by examining the
association between the air pollution level and negative health outcomes
(we consider RI for this study)1 in the opencast coal mining region (Angul-
Talcher) of Odisha. This study also tries to analyse the economic impact of
negative health effects by considering the loss of wages of productive days
for the study region.

mining activities contributed to the health-related well-being of the local
community in the mining region and to their environment? (2) Does the
critical ambient air quality near the opencast coal belt matter to the health
of the neighbouring community? (3) How do the socio-economic factors
affected the health stock of the local communities in the neighbourhood of
coal mining areas? (4) How many productive days are lost by the local
communities due to RI related diseases on account of such negative
externalities ?
Against this backdrop, the study area is located in a coal mining district
Angul of Odisha, in the eastern part of India. The state has two coalfields
namely- Talcher coalfield (in Angul district) and lb River coalfield (in
Jharsuguda district).The coalfield of Ib valley is comparatively new
compared to that of Talcher coal field(Directorate of Mines, Government
of Odisha, Bhubaneswar). The older the coal mines project, the more is its
environmental impact. The numbers of active opencast coal mine projects
are also larger in Talcher coal field area than the IB valley coal field. As per
the latest report by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB 2009) on
Comprehensive Environment Assessment of Industrial Clusters, Talcher
coal filed region of Odisha has secured seventh position as one of the most

asthma, cough with mucus, and sputum production, respiration allergy to dust, allergic
cough, running nose, headache, flu, and fever, chest tightness, pain, and acute bronchitis.
These symptoms are identified as commonly reported respiratory illness after consulting the
specialist doctors from the Mahanadi Coal Field Hospital, located in the study region.

3. DEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN
RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND AIR POLLUTION: DOSE-
RESPONSE FUNCTION
Often, the relationship between air pollution and premature mortality is
studied by using time-series analysis of daily observations of number of
deaths and the pollution level. These studies capture the effects of the
short-term exposure to pollution on the probability of dying. But it is
expected that people, who are in a weak physical state or who have a history
of chronic diseases are more susceptible to contact recurring diseases due to
the high concentration of pollution in the environment and are therefore
supposed to be the most vulnerable. These types of exposure can be
captured through the ‘dose-response function‘. If there is a cause of high
2 The concentration of PM 10 in air is very high for the study region which often exceeds the
prescribed level (by Central Pollution Control Board) by two folds. See the table no (1) and
(2) for detail about the severity of air pollution.
3 See Figure 3 for the district wise extraction and value of coal in Odisha in recent year.
[51] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
concentration of pollutants in the surrounding environment, then it may
trigger some negative health outcome (i.e., negative externalities of
environmental pollution) as its effect. This association between cause and
effect has been known as ‗dose-response function‘.4
This function captures a range of responses towards the respiratory illness
of different individuals due to different degree of outdoor pollutants, when
other confounding socio-economic factors and the level of indoor pollution
are controlled. This function therefore relates the importance of a ‗Dose‘
(that is the intensity of air pollution to which the local people are exposed)
to the ‗responsiveness‘ of the individuals (the response may be any kind of
morbidity due to the respiratory diseases, stress, and even death or
mortality). The degree of impact can be captured as the proportion or the
days of sickness or restricted activity days due to respiratory illness
syndromes (H).This method estimates the partial derivative (or the slope of
b) of ‗Dose-Response‘ function as given in the following equation (1). The
purpose is to calculate the marginal effect of a change in occurrence of a
given health outcome related to a change in air ambient quality (A) with
other confounding factors.

2013-14 (Quantity in lakh MT and value in crore of rupees)

The next step by Ostro (1994) is to calculate the numbers of people who
are supposed to be exposed to the particular air pollution effect (i.e.
POPi).Then how many productive days (restricted activity days or sick
days), they are losing because of the exposure. Finally, the last step is to
4See Ostro (1983, 1987, 1994), who estimated the ‗Dose-Response Function‘ to find out the
impact of air pollution on morbidity and found that PM , affect both the restricted activity

days and work days lost.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [52]
calculate the welfare gain due to a unit change or reduction in ambient air
quality (dA).
Thus the dose-response function can be expressed as (following Ostro
1994):
dH b*POP*dA (1)
i i
Where,dH = change in individual‘s risk of health outcome i
i
b= slope from the ‗dose-response‘ function.
POP = targeted population at risk of health impact i
i
dA = change in ambient air quality under consideration
4. SURVEY DESIGN
The present study is based on the primary survey at the household level,
though pollution data are collected from the secondary sources such as
State Pollution Control Board, Odisha and Regional Pollution Control
Board, Angul. To understand the severity of air pollution on the health
outcome of the local residents we first conducted a pilot survey followed by
five rounds of group discussions during September 2015. Baseline
information was collected from that pilot survey from some randomly
selected households in the vicinity of Mahanadi Coal Field Limited. The
baseline information did confirm the severity of health problem in the
region. To capture the exposure of air pollution on human health (for those
who are residing near the coal field area) through ‗dose-response‘ method,
we required background information on the health status of individuals
residing in the study region along with other environmental and socio-
economic information. The pilot survey helped us to design a well-
structured questionnaire for the final survey. We conducted the survey
during September 2015 to January 2016, involving (210) households of the
10 neighbouring villages, of Angul-Talcher opencast coal mining region of
Mahanadi Coal Field Limited (MCL). Following Krupanick (2000), Gupta
(2008), Murty et al. (2003), Adhikari (2012) and Imran et al. (2010), the
survey kept track of weekly health diary of the selected households for six
weeks extended over two seasons. We followed two stage stratification, for
selecting sample (following Gupta 2006 and Adhikari 2012). The reason for
following a two stage stratification sampling procedure is to capture
precisely the local people‘s exposure to air pollution and the consequent
adverse health impact. In the first stage of stratification, the villages within a
four-kilometre radius from the air pollution monitoring station were
identified (and a total 10 villages were selected. We then randomly selected
[53] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
21 households from each village. Thus a total of (21 x 10 = 210)
households from 10 villages and an aggregate of 855 members were
surveyed5. Out of 855 household members 254 members were suffering
from RI symptoms during the first round of the survey. Given the seasonal
differentiates in air quality levels, we collected health diary information on
254 household members repeatedly for six weeks during two different
seasons (i.e. October or post-monsoon and December or winter). The
health diaries covered the RI-related health status, of mitigating
expenditure, chronic illness etc. Therefore the survey resulted in a pooled
data, containing 1524 (= 254 x 6) observations. But by using the Stata
software 12.0, we found only 932(restrictive sample) observations having RI
diseases, sick days, and mitigating expenses over the entire 6 weeks. Given
that the present study is focused on the number of RI-related sick days, so a
total of 932 observations on the basis of availability of full information
could only be taken for empirical investigation.
5. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATION OF RI-RELATED SICK DAYS
Our goal is to estimate the number of sick days or restricted activity days of
a person suffering from respiratory diseases. This dependent variable
counts the duration of sickness episode which is related to the particular
respiratory syndromes (associated with air pollution) based on one week
recall period6.The dependent variable counts how many days in a week
(based on one week recall period), an individual is unable to work or
restricted from other activities due to respiratory illness. As our dependent
variable i.e., ‗sick days‘ is finite number of non-negative integers (small
discrete values, say 0 1 2, 3, 4, …) or count values, assuming 0 values in
several observations, we need a probability distribution that takes care of
this count data. We used the Poisson and Negative Binomial regression to
model the count outcomes i.e., the negative health impacts of air pollution
(captured by the number of restricted activity days) as experienced by the
respondent in a given time period.
5 The sampling framework takes into account the randomly selected households from each
of the 10 villages, which are located within a stipulated area i.e., 4 km radius surrounding the
station. So the selection bias is likely to be minimum and therefore can be comfortably
ignored. Here proximity is used to identify the neighbourhood areas which are very close
within the radius of 4 km from the opencast coal mines.
6 For the primary survey we collected information regarding the prevalence of RI-related
diseases and the mitigating expenditure incurred by the household and therefore we set the
recall period of one week. This is deliberately done to extract correct information on the
mitigating expenditure data.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [54]
Given that Poisson regression is the starting point of count data analysis,
we initially fitted the Poisson regression to the number of sick days by using
the method of Pseudo Maximum Likelihood Estimation or Quasi-
Maximum likelihood estimation. It is possible to write the probability of
number of sick days(Y) for a respective individual, using the Poisson
regression model as:
Prob. 

Y 
y
it 



it
y
it
eit
,y 0,1,23,...7.... (2)
  it x   y ! it
it it
whereex
i
Here y denotes the RI-related sick days or restricted activity days (related
it
to air pollution level) for an individual i at time period t. ‗e‘ is the exponential
function of y  , the mean value of the number of sick days due to
it it
pollution.  is the vector of regression coefficients while x is the vector
it
of independent variables. And u is the unobserved error term that may
it
affect the individual health stock.
The estimated mean value is therefore: ˆ eˆx. A log transformation gives
t
the equation: lnˆ ˆx
i
As the count data variance usually exceeds the mean, the Poisson model has
its limitation arising from the property of equi-dispersion. Alternatively we
also run the negative binomial model (NBM) as an alternative model which
accounts for the overdispersion in count data, when the conditional
variance surpasses the conditional mean. The only difference between two
is that NBM has an ancillary parameter (α) to model the overdispersion.
5.1. Choice Variables
The vector of explanatory variables comprises of daily PM data obtained
10
from the nearest air pollution monitoring station from the respondents'
residence. The study has narrowed down the ‗daily (PM )‘ as the single-
10
most important indicator for air pollution in the coal belt, as the exposure
to PM is considered to be most damaging impact on respiratory health
10
(Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010).7
7 Several research findings show high concentrations of lower atmospheric pollution
especially RSPM (PM ) contribute to human morbidity, increase respiratory syndromes, and
10
reduced lung functions (Gupta 2006; Chowdhury and Imran 2010). The secondary data on
air pollution shows that in open cast coal mining areas in Odisha, the PM level is

dust,10 smoking etc., to avoid overestimation of pollution exposure on
health effects of the respondents. Besides these individual characteristics
vulnerable to air pollution exposure and is therefore supposed to have higher number of
illness related sick days. This is used as control variable in our econometric analysis, which
captures the occurrence of chronic illness among the individuals. It assigns a value ‗1‘ if the
respondent reports a chronic diseases (as mentioned above) otherwise it assigns a value ‗0‘.
10As discussed, coal is one of the most polluting natural resources (because it emits toxic
pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, respiratory suspended particulate matters
etc. to atmosphere). The brittle nature of coal creates coal dust in the coal mining activities
including loading unloading, transportation etc. In the open cast coal mining neighbourhood
villages, the suspended coal dusts often create haze in the atmosphere which often interrupts
visibility. Given these facts it is evident that regular exposure of the air borne contaminants
due to coal and coal dust may trigger respiratory illness. It is anticipated that more outdoor
exposure may increase the probability of illness. The exposure to coal dust is a dummy
variable which assigns 1 if the representative individual is exposed to outdoor coal dust (or
stay in outdoor more than 1 hour a day), otherwise it is 0 (zero).

6. REGRESSION ANALYSIS
The regression result of the Poisson and NBMs are given in Tables 5 and 6,
which display the regression coefficients, standard errors, and probability
values (z>p) for each explanatory variable.
In table (5) and (6), both the regression model (Poisson and NB) present
approximately similar results, because the ‗α‘ value (the parameter which
accounts for overdispersion) is very small (i.e., - 0.0103) in NBM. The only
difference is that the Poisson model gives the robust standard error (as it is
based on pseudo maximum likelihood method and the NBM accounts the
overdispersion as it has one ancillary parameter i.e., α.
The regression results confirms our hypothesis that there is a positive and
significant relationship between the level of air pollution (RSPM/PM ) and
10
RI-related sick days. The coefficient of PM (0.0059) is positive and
10
statistically significant at 1 per cent level of significance (p-value is 0.001 or
equivalently t-value is 4.22) in the Poisson model. The positive coefficient
of pollution variable depicts that a reduction in air pollution level (PM
10
level) will cause a reduction in expected number of RI-related sick days. The
coefficient of awareness regarding pollution related health impact is
negative and significant at 1 per cent level; showing a decrease in sick days
due to the rise in awareness level. The coefficient of chronic diseases
asthma is positive and significant at 1 per cent level, thereby presenting an
increase in sick days as the chronic asthma increases. The other socio-
economic and control variables such as individual smoking habits, coal-
fuel12 and illness in previous week have positive coefficients as expected
and are also statistically significant.13
The coal as a daily household fuel has been controlled for indoor air
pollution. This variable is statistically significant and positive impact on
aggravating the respiratory illness and its related sick days. The individuals
who have active smoking habits are more susceptible to the exposure of air
pollution and thus respiratory illness related sick days increases for them.
12 The frequency of using ‗coal‘ as a cooking fuel contributes to the level of indoor air
pollution. The study assumes it as a dummy variable giving the value 1 if a representative
household uses coal for their cooking regularly. Here, we consider if a household uses coal
as a fuel for cooking more than 20 times in a month, then we take the value 1 and it takes 0
otherwise.
13 We have checked the multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity test for the model after
running the regression and found these problems among the independent variables are not a
serious concern for the model. The Wald chi2 (15) is 95.28 with p-value 0.000, which
indicates the model is significant as a whole.
[59] Tapaswini Nayak and Indrani Roy Chowdhury
The presence of respiratory illness in the previous week among the
individual increases the risk of experiencing more RI-related sick days.

7. WELFARE GAIN (IN MONETARY TERMS) OF THE
REDUCTION IN RI-RELATED SICK DAYS
To estimate the monetary benefits from the reduction in RI-related sick
days, we calculate the marginal effect from the Poisson regression. Marginal
effect defines the reduction in RI-related sick days due to the fall in PM
10
levels in air.
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [60]
Following Gupta (2006), Chowdhury and Imran (2010) and Adhikari
(2012), monetary benefits from reduction in RI-related sick days can be
expressed as:
365
PM  (3)
10 7
Where  is the coefficient value of PM from Poisson regression model (β
10
= 0.0059)
λ is the predicted value of (H) or RI sick days from the Poisson model (λ =
0.0205)
(λ= 0.0205, is the predicted value of sick days from the Poisson model,
which is calculated by the help of post-regression analysis command in
Stata-12.0)
∆PM is the change in the level of PM from the current to the safe
10 10
standard prescribed level, (the average current level PM in two seasons is
10
159 µg /m3 and the prescribed standard level by Odisha Pollution Control
Board (OPCB) is 90.4 µg /m3 for residential area.)
(β * λ) is the marginal gain from Poisson estimation or (0.0059 * 0.0205 =
0.00012)
The Poisson regression result shows that 1 µg /m3 reduction in PM results
10
in a marginal benefit of 0.00012(days) for a representative household
member in a week. In order to calculate the welfare gain in sick days for a
representative household member by reduction in PM to a safe level, we
10
have to multiply the marginal benefit value by ΔPM i.e., 0.00012 * 68.6 =
10
0.00823 as gain in reduction in sick days for a representative household
member. The annual benefit in monetary terms or welfare gain can be
365
calculated by multiplying this value 0.00823 with the i.e., 0.4292 as
7
annual monetary benefit for reduction in sick days due to reduction in PM
10
level or improvement of PM .
10
Putting the values in equation (3)
0.0059 * 0.0205 * 68.6 * 52.14 = (0.43) days per year for a representative
household member.
Here: β = 0.0059, λ = 0.0205, ΔPM = 159 µg /m3 - 90.4 µg /m3 = 68.6 µg

from working group sample from the survey data. Thus the annual
monetary gain for a representative household member is 0.43 * 275=
Rs.118.25 by avoiding the RI-related sick days due to reduction in PM
10
level. By extrapolating for the total population of Talcher coal mining area,
the monetary welfare gain from avoiding the RI-related sick days are
estimated as Rs. 64, 95,51,5.66 per annum.
However our study presents lower bound estimation of monetary welfare
gain (of health improvement) from the reduction in air pollution in the
opencast coal mining of MCL of Talcher area. The study has the limitation
of not capturing the averting expenditure of air pollution and the
opportunity cost of time spent for seeking care. It poses a serious constraint
to gather information on these variables from the survey because of the
heterogeneity of the respondents (covering children, women, and old
persons other than the working people). Moreover the region is endowed
with some active public health centres run by MCL, offering some basic
health services to the local community. The out of pocket expenditure
which was captured during the survey was mainly the expense incurred by
the residents from the private consultation over and above the free services
they can avail from primary healthcare centres (PHC). The compulsion to
visit the private practitioner was mainly due to congestion, long waiting
time, recurrence, lack of doctor, non-availability of medicine etc., as
reported in the survey.
8. CONCLUSION
For developmental processes, the economic importance of coal is
undoubtedly very high, being the cheapest source of energy. However coal
is the most polluting natural resource; from production to combustion it
leads to the emissions of various harmful gases including methane (CH ),
4
sulfur dioxide (SO ), and nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon monoxide (CO),
2 x
particulate matter, various toxins, etc. Besides coal dust, coal wastes, and
coal particles are produced during the mining process, soot is released
during the transportation of coal. It is evident from various studies that all
these pollutants can cause severe and potentially deadly respiratory and lung
problems, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, apart from the direct impact
of the occupational hazards of the coal miners, coal mining activities
(particularly opencast coal mining), imposes highly negative environmental
externalities (through air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination and
fertility loss and forest loss and degradation) and health externalities (in
terms of poor quality of health among the local communities, living in the
Ecology, Economy and Society–the INSEE Journal [62]
proximity of opencast coal mining region). Although there is huge
economic cost involved in tackling these environmental and health
externalities,14 it is seldom addressed seriously at the policy level or in the
implementation stage. Thus the pricing of coal involves huge cross-
subsidies in India from the unaccounted environmental and health
damages. Even the conservative attempt of imputing these negative
externalities in the pricing of coal would have increased the price of coal
several folds.
This primary concern of this paper has been on the impact of air pollution
on respiratory health (in terms of their number of sick days or restricted
days due to RI) among the residents of some coal mining regions of
Odisha. The attempt is to capture the partial impact of air pollution
(triggered by coal production) on respiratory health damages. Given that
the level of PM is always at an alarming level in the Angul-Talcher coal
10
mining region, it is natural to expect that the respiratory health outcome
would be very pervasive and critical in the proximity of the coal field. It is
evident from the literature that the critical air pollution level (particularly
concentration of PM in air) affects the respiratory health status (lung and
10
chest problems, cough, bronchial asthma, bronchitis, TB and other lung
related diseases) of the residents in the proximity of the coal field.
Our empirical exercise predict the likelihood of RI-related sickness (in
terms of their restricted days/sick days) of the residents near the open cast
coal mines (due to air pollution). We find there is a strong and direct
relation between acute respiratory disease related sick days or restricted
activity days and the level PM (air pollution) in Angul-Talcher coal mining
10
area. The positive value of the coefficient of pollution variable depicts that
a reduction in air pollution level (PM level) causes a reduction in expected
10
number of RI-related sick days. We find that a representative individual in
the Angul-Talcher region can save 0.43 days or Rs. 118. 25 by avoiding the
14 See Epstein et al. (2011, 92). At the Center for Health and the Global Environment,
Harvard Medical School, Dr. Paul Epstein and others found that accounting for the full
costs of coal would double or triple its price. The study, released in the Annals of the New
York Academy of Sciences, tallied the economic, health, and environmental costs associated
with each stage in the life cycle of coal—extraction, transportation, processing, and
combustion—and estimated those costs, which are borne by the public at large, at USD
175–500 billion annually. Air pollutants from combustion accounted for USD 187.5 billion,
mercury impacts as much as USD 29.3 billion. The report estimated the public health
burden in Appalachian communities at USD 74.6 billion a year, and that death, injury, and
increased healthcare costs constituted much of the impact. The study discussed several other
impacts that are not easily quantified: coal mining and processing releases heavy metal toxins
and carcinogens into water supplies; coal miners die at work or are injured; and coal mining
societies are impacted.

RI-related sick days, if there is a reduction of 68.6 µg /m3 of PM per year.
10
This is calculated by taking the difference between the average current level
of PM in the two seasons (i.e. 159 µg /m3) and the standard level (i.e., 90.4
10
µg /m3) as prescribed by the OPCB. Thus the monetary welfare gain from
avoiding the RI-related sick days for the entire population of Talcher coal
mining area are estimated to be Rs. 64, 95,515. 66 per annum. Although the
study derives the lower bound estimates of monetary gain due to the
reduction in air pollution, the figures bears some serious policy concerns.

Introduction Data Analysis Discussion
Air pollution is a major environmental health concern, responsible
for millions of deaths globally per year (WHO, 2021). India is one
of the country having highest pollution levels across worldwide.
Common air pollutants like SO2, NO2, and CO have been
associated with increased mortality and morbidity (Ghude et al.,
2016). Effective air quality management and epidemiologic
research requires extensive Spatio-temporal monitoring of
pollution levels across India. However, ground monitoring has
limited spatial coverage in India (Guttikunda & Jawahar, 2018). In
Odisha there is a lack of extensive ground monitoring

Findings The annual population-weighted mean exposure to ambient particulate matter PM in India was 89·9 μg/m³

(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 67·0–112·0) in 2017. Most states, and 76·8% of the population of India, were exposed to
annual population-weighted mean PM greater than 40 μg/m³, which is the limit recommended by the National
2·5
Ambient Air Quality Standards in India. Delhi had the highest annual population-weighted mean PM in 2017, followed
2·5
by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana in north India, all with mean values greater than 125 μg/m³. The proportion of
population using solid fuels in India was 55·5% (54·8–56·2) in 2017, which exceeded 75% in the low SDI states of Bihar,
Jharkhand, and Odisha. 1·24 million (1·09–1·39) deaths in India in 2017, which were 12·5% of the total deaths, were
attributable to air pollution, including 0·67 million (0·55–0·79) from ambient particulate matter pollution and
0·48 million (0·39–0·58) from household air pollution. Of these deaths attributable to air pollution, 51·4% were in
people younger than 70 years. India contributed 18·1% of the global population but had 26·2% of the global air pollution
DALYs in 2017. The ambient particulate matter pollution DALY rate was highest in the north Indian states of Uttar
Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, spread across the three SDI state groups, and the household air
pollution DALY rate was highest in the low SDI states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam in north
and northeast India. We estimated that if the air pollution level in India were less than the minimum causing health loss,
the average life expectancy in 2017 would have been higher by 1·7 years (1·6–1·9), with this increase exceeding 2 years in
the north Indian states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana.
Interpretation India has disproportionately high mortality and disease burden due to air pollution. This burden is
generally highest in the low SDI states of north India. Reducing the substantial avoidable deaths and disease burden
from this major environmental risk is dependent on rapid deployment of effective multisectoral policies throughout
India that are commensurate with the magnitude of air pollution in each state.

Abstract
In this study we aim to assess 16 priority PAHs enlisted by the US Environmental Protection Agency in PM
2.5 and PM 10 for the  rst time from industrial areas of Odisha State in India. During 2017–2018,
bimonthly sampling of PM 10 and PM 2.5 were carried out for 24 hours by respirable dust sampler and
PM 2.5 sampler respectively, in the industrial and mining areas of Jharsuguda (n = 2) and Angul (n = 4)
during the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post monsoonal seasons. Highest average concentration of 16
PAHs in PM 2.5 was observed during post monsoon (170 ng/m3) followed by pre-monsoon (17–89 ∑
ng/m3; avg, 48 ng/m3) and monsoonal season (2–40 ng/m3 ; avg, 16 ng/m 3 ), respectively. Similar trend
of 16 PAHs levels in PM 10 was seen with higher levels during post monsoon (116–471 ng/m3; avg,
286∑ ng/m3) followed by pre-monsoon (avg, 81 ng/m3) and monsoon seasons (27 ng/m3. Diagnostic
ratios BaA/(BaA + Chry), Phe/(Phe + Ant) and Flt/(Flt + Pyr) and principal component analysis (PCA)
suggest diesel, gasoline and coal combustion are the major contributors for atmospheric PAHs pollution
in Odisha. Back trajectories analysis revealed that PAHs concentration was affected majorly by air
masses originating from the northwest direction traversing through central India. Toxic equivalents
(TEQs) ranged between 0.24 to 94.13 ng TEQ/m3. In our study incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR)
ranged between 10 − 5 and 10 − 3 representing potential cancer risk.
1. Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of major concern due to their carcinogenicity, genotoxicity
and ubiquitous nature. PAHs can be majorly formed during incomplete combustion (pyrolysis) or high
temperature pyrolytic processes of organic materials and combustion of fossil fuels (Chen et al., 2007).
They are pervasive environmental pollutants that are characterized by their hazardous carcinogenic and
mutagenic potential (Carreras et al., 2013; McGrath et al., 2007). PAHs have received increased attention
in recent years due to their diverse sources and their ubiquitous presence in all the environmental
components (air, soil, and water) not only in developing but also in developed countries. The primary
sources of PAHs are of anthropogenic origin viz., motor vehicle exhaust, petroleum re neries, heating in
power plants, combustion of refuse, deposition from sewage, oil/gasoline spills, tobacco smoke,
barbeque smoke and coke production (Christensen and Bzdusek, 2005; Moon et al., 2006). The US
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a list of 16 priority PAHs in 1995. This list was
expanded in 2008 to 28 priority compounds that present a serious hazard for human health (Ravindra et
al., 2008). Benzo(a)pyrene (5-ring PAH) is the most commonly measured PAHs and is used as an
indicator of carcinogenic hazard in polluted environments. Moreover PAHs with a larger number of
aromatic rings are mostly bound to particulate matter associated with urban emissions (Possanzini et al.,
2004). With the rapid social and economic development over the past several decades, air pollution due
to PAHs has been both serious and widespread in India. The highest concentrations of atmospheric PAHs
can be found in urban environments due to increasing vehicular tra c, coal combustion for power
generation and low dispersion of the atmospheric pollutants (Caricchia et al., 1999).
Page 2/23
PM and PM are 25 to 100 times thinner than a human hair and can travel into the respiratory tract,
10 2.5
penetrate deep into the lungs and even into the blood stream and cause severe health damage. Research
shows that every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM , increases all-cause mortality between 3–26 %, chances of
2.5
childhood asthma by 16 %, chances of lung cancer by 36% and heart attacks by 44 % (Airveda, 2017).
The state of Odisha has a tropical climate, characterized by high temperature and humidity, medium to
high rainfall and mild winters. Serious air pollution in the industrial areas of Odisha over the past decade
has attracted much attention. In India, studies were mainly carried out in large cities but no detailed study
has been reported from Odisha despite the fact that the city is surrounded by multifarious industries of
small, medium and large scales along with several coal mines. Hence, in the year 2017–2018 we took the
 rst attempt to monitor atmospheric PAHs in PM and PM in the industrial cities in the state of Odisha
2.5 10
and the major objectives of this study were to (i) monitor 16 USEPA enlisted priority PAHs in two major
industrial areas of Odisha viz., Angul and Jharsuguda during, summer or pre-monsoon (March - May),
monsoon (June - September) and winter or post-monsoon (October - January) (ii) identify the probable
sources by applying principal component analysis (PCA) and diagnostic ratios, (iii) identify the origin of
air mass by Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model’s back-trajectory
analysis (iv) assess the potential health risk posed by particulate-bound PAHs using USEPA health risk
assessment model.
2. Materials And Methods
2.1 Study Site
Angul district is surrounded by Cuttack & Dhenkanal on the east, Sambalpur & Deogarh on the west,
Sundargarh & Keonjhar on the north and Phulbani on the south. Covering an area of 6232 sq.km, Angul
District is located at Latitude 20.50o north and 85.00 o east Longitude. Agriculture occupies a vital place
in the economy of Angul district. However, in the last decade there is a tremendous growth in industrial
sector. Jharsuguda is one of the most industrially developed districts of Odisha. The district is
surrounded by Sundargarh district in the North, Sambalpur district in the East, Bargarh district in the
South and Chattisgarh state in the West. Jharsuguda district is covering total area of 2,081 sq kms. The
district is rich in minerals like coals, quartzite and  re clay. Besides deposits of limestone & granite, white
sand stone and laterite stone are also found in several places of Jharsuguda district that add to economy
of the district. The district lies at 21.82o north latitude and 84.1o east longitude. Details of sampling
locations are given in supporting information (SI) Table S1 alongwith the detailed site descriptions.
2.2 Sample collection
During all the seasons from March 2017 to January 2018 i.e., summer or pre-monsoon (March - May),
monsoon (June - September) and winter or post – monsoon (October - January), twice in each season
PM and PM sampling were conducted at Angul (from four substations) and Jharsuguda (from two
2.5 10
substations), in the state of Odisha, India (Fig. 1). A total of 36 PM samples and 108 PM samples
2.5 10
Page 3/23
were collected during this sampling campaign. From Angul-Talcher, 24 PM and 72 PM samples were
2.5 10
collected (for six times 3 samples were collected from each location of 4 sub-stations). From
Jharsuguda, 12 PM and 36 PM samples (twice 3 samples were collected from each location of 2
2.5 10
substations) were collected. Details of sampling locations are given in Table S1 of supporting
information (SI). The PM samples were collected using  ne dust sampler (Envirotech APM − 550)
2.5
which operated at a  ow rate of 16.67 L/min for 24 h to collect particle bound PAHs in PTFE Filter paper.
PM sampler (Envirotech, APM 460 NL, India) was used with a  ow of 0.9–1.1 L/min to collect particle
10
bound PAHs in 20.3 x 25.4 cm glass  ber  lter (EPM 2000). Each sample for PM 10 was collected in three
shifts (8 Hourly basis) in 24 h to avoid pressure drop due to loading of particulate matter on  lter paper
After 24 hours (h), the samples were taken and wrapped with aluminum foil and stored in desiccators.
The sample  lters were stabilized in a temperature and humidity-controlled incubator before and after
collection at 25 ± 1°C and 52 ± 1 % relative humidity for 24 h.. All the  lters were weighed using an
electronic microbalance (Sartorius T-114) before analysis. Filter papers wrapped in aluminium foils and
stored at -20°C prior to analysis. Filter papers were desiccated for 24 h before taking initial weight prior to
the sampling. In the same manner  nal weight for  lter papers were taken after sample collection.
2.3 Sample extraction and clean up
Exposed  lter paper was cut into small pieces in a 250 mL beaker. Ultrasonic extraction was conducted
using 100 mL of toluene and was repeated for three times. The extracted samples were then  ltered using
Whatman  lter paper and were pooled together. The pooled extracts were reduced to ~ 1mL using rotary
evaporator with water bath (temp below 40 0 C).
Clean-up was performed using silica gel column having length of 200 mm and inner diameter (ID) of 0.5
cm. Slurry of 3g deactivated silica gel (60–100 mesh size) in cyclohexane was poured into the column.
Conditioning was performed using toluene followed by cyclohexane. Samples were passed drop-wise and
eluted using cyclohexane. Further, 30 mL of cyclohexane were added to the column to elute all organics
of interest. Pooled samples were reduced to 1 mL and store in a dark and cool place.
2.4 Instrumental analysis
Sixteen priority PAHs were analysed using Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph coupled with Agilent 19091,
J-413, 325 0C capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25µm). 2 µL of each sample was injected in split-
less mode. High purity 99.999% nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, with a  ow rate of 1 mL/min. The
temperature of the injector and transfer lines were 250 0C and 300 0C respectively. The initial oven
temperature was set at 120 0C for 2 min, increased to 300 0C at a rate of 7 0C/min and then maintained
for 10 min. The concentrations of 16 PAHs were quanti ed according to their elution orders as follows;
naphthalene (Nap, m/z 128), acenaphthylene (Acy, m/z 152), acenaphthene (Ace, m/z 154),  uorene (Flu,
m/z 166), phenanthrene (Phe, m/z 178), anthracene (Ant, m/z 178),  uoranthene (Flt, m/z 202), pyrene
(Pyr, m/z 202), benzo(a)anthracene (BaA, m/z 228), chrysene (Chry, m/z 228), benzo (b)  uoranthene
(BbF, m/z 252), benzo(k) uoranthene (BkF, m/z 252), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP, m/z 252), indeno(1,2,3-
cd)pyrene (InP, m/z 276), dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (DBA, m/z 278), benzo(ghi)perylene (BghP, m/z 276).
Page 4/23
2.5 Quality assurance and control
The analytical method was based on the USEPA Method TO-13. Field blanks,  lter blanks and solvent
blanks were analyzed by the same procedure as the samples and it was ensured that there were no
signi cant background interferences. The quanti cations were performed using the internal standard
method. For quality control check SRM urban dust No 1649a was used to check recovery. Recovery %
was between 75–130 % and is presented in details in SI Table S2.
2.6. Atmospheric Transport Model
HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) is an atmospheric model developed by
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Air Resource Laboratory, which has proven as
a powerful tool for researchers to simulate the transport of particles in the atmosphere and provide
information on where air-parcels originate from (Draxler et al., 1999; Hegarty et al., 2013; Maurer et al.,
2018). HYSPLIT has the ability for a hybrid calculation approach and uses both Lagrangian (moving
frame of reference for diffusion and advection) and Eulerian ( xed model grid for calculation of air
concentration) methods (Stein et al., 2015)
2.6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM-SPSS Statistics software (version 22). All the tests of
signi cance were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test.
2.7 Risk assessment
2.7.1 Toxic equivalents
Toxic equivalents (TEQs) of the PAHs were calculated using toxicity equivalent factors (TEF) of all PAHs.
The following equation was used to calculate the toxicity as done in earlier studies (Chen and Chen, 2011;
Li et al., 2015; Nasher et al., 2013; Peters et al., 1999)
Total TEQ = C × TEF
i i
∑
where, C = concentration of individual PAH fraction, TEF = toxicity factor relative, which represents the
i i
ratio of the toxicity of a PAH congener to that of B(a)P.
The TEF of all the individual PAHs are given in SI Table S3 (Cincinelli et al., 2007; EPA, 1993).
2.7.2 Cancer Risk Assessment
Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) exposure to carcinogenic PAHs (BaA, Chry, BkF, BbF, BaP, Ind, and
DbA) were estimated by using the lifetime average daily dose (LADD) and the cancer slope factor (CSF).
Page 5/23
The LADD is the intake quantity of a known pollutant with a potential to cause adverse health effects
when absorbed into the body over a period of time (Jamhari et al., 2014). In this study, the LADD and the
ILCR were computed for infants (0– 1 year), children (2–5 years), children (6–12 years), and adults (19–
75 years). The LADDs through the inhalation (LADD ), ingestion (LADD ), and dermal (LADD )
inh ing derm
pathways were estimated using
LADD = [C x InhR x ET x EF x ED x CF] / [BW x AT]
inh
LADD = [C x IngR x ET x EF x ED x CF] / [BW x AT]
ing
LADD = [Cx SA x AF x ABS x ET x EF x ED x CF] / [BW x AT]
derm
ILCR = LADD x CSF
where C = concentration of PAHs (ng/m3); ED = exposure duration (days); BW = body weight of the
exposed group (kg); AT = averaging time (days), ET = exposure time (h/day); IngR = ingestion rate
(mg/day); InhR = inhalation rate (m3/day); SA = surface area of the skin exposed to pollutants (cm2); AF =
skin adherence factor (mg/cm2/day); ABS = dermal absorption factor; EF = exposure frequency
(days/year); CSF = cancer slope factor (mg− 1 kg day) and CF = unit conversion factor (C = 10− 6). The
values of these parameters are taken from a previous study (Morakinyo et al., 2019b).
3. Results And Discussion
3.1 Levels and comparison with other studies
PM
2.5
The overall range of PAHs in PM during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon were 17–89
16 2.5
ng/m3, 2–40 ng/m3 a∑nd 74–282 ng/m3 respectively. The mean concentration of total carcinogenic PAHs
in Jharsuguda and Angul was 52 ng/m3 and 40 ng/m3 respectively. The mean concentration of
PAHs in Jharsuguda (102 ng/m3) was two folds higher than Angul (66 ng/m3) (Table 1). In both
16
∑sites, the overall trend of PAHs pollution was observed as post monsoon > pre monsoon > monsoon (SI
Table S4 and S5). Concentration of PAHs in Odisha during post monsoon was 3 folds higher than pre
16
monsoon and 10 folds higher than m∑onsoon. PM bound PAHs were signi cantly different (p < 0.05)
2.5
between three seasons (SI Table S8 ). Furthermore, signi cant difference of individual PAHs between
different seasons were observed in all the stations (p < 0.05).The overall mean concentration for all the
seasons for PAHs in PM in industrial regions of Odisha was slightly lower than Zhengzhou (111
16 2.5
ng/m3) (Wan∑g et al., 2014). Mean PAHs concentrations in industrial sites of Odisha were comparable
16
with Beijing (244 ng/m3) (Wang et∑ al., 2008), Nanjing (125 ng/m3) (Wang et al., 2007), Xian (140 ng/m3)
(Bandowe et al., 2014) in China, New Delhi in India (105 ng/m3), (Sarkar and Khillare, 2013), Zonguldak in
Page 6/23
Turkey (94 ng/m3) (Akyüz and Çabuk, 2009) but higher than Atlanta in USA (3 ng/m3) (Li et al.2009),
Norway (8.60 ng/m3) and United Kingdom (11.20 ng/m3) (Eeftens et al., 2012) and Madrid in Spain (15
ng/m3) (Barrado et al., 2013) (Table S6).

Overall range of PAHs in PM during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon were 34–145
16 10
ng/m3, 3–65 ng/∑m3 and 116–479 ng/m3, respectively. Similar to the trend of PM , the mean
2.5
concentrations of total and carcinogenic PAHs were highest during post monsoon season. The mean
concentration of PAHs for all the seasons in Jharsuguda (176 ng/m3) was higher than Angul site
16
(109 ng/m3) (Tab∑le S4 and S5). PAHs pollution was observed in the order post monsoon > pre monsoon >
monsoon which is in line with the observation in PM . PM bound PAHs were signi cantly different (p
2.5 10
< 0.05) between three seasons (SI Table S9). Furthermore, signi cant difference of individual PAHs
between different seasons were observed in all the stations (p < 0.05). Higher PAHs level in the post-
monsoonal season can be reasoned with lower temperature, photochemical composition and radiation
thereby reducing the evaporation from particulate to the vapour phase and stronger photochemical
composition of PAHs (Feng et al., 2005; Odabasi et al., 1999). However, lower concentrations of PAHs
during monsoon can be associated with washing out effect for particulates (Karar and Gupta, 2006).
The mean concentration of total PAHs in PM (131 ng/m3) was higher than Agra (43 ng/m3) (Masih et
10
al., 2010), Visakhapatnam (57 ng/m3) (Kulkarni et al., 2014) but lower than Kanpur (616 ng/m3) (Singh et
al., 2015), Tiruchirapalli (259 ng/m3) (Mohanraj et al., 2011) and Amritsar (154 ng/m3) (Kaur et al., 2013)
Page 9/23
in India. The mean concentration of total PAHs were higher than urban Malaysia (6 ng/m3) (Omar et al.,
2002) and Xiamen in China (15 ng/m3) (Hong et al., 2007) (Table S7).
3.2. Seasonality and back trajectory analysis
HYSPLIT back trajectories analysis were performed over both Angul and Jharsuguda (Fig. 2). The air
mass  ve days back trajectories for each hour (00 to 23 Z) at height of 500 m above ground level (AGL)
of 144 trajectories (6 Days x 24 hours = 144 trajectories) were clustered into 3 clusters. Each site had
different 6 day samples and the Reanalysis data resolution was 2.5o x 2.5o, for Angul, single plot was
made for 4 locations. Radiosonde data over Bhubaneswar from University of Wyoming (Department of
Atmospheric Science, University of Wyoming, http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html) was
used for the 6 days corresponding to sample collection dates.
Figure 2a shows the three major clusters at Angul site. The three cluster types were studied as per
direction, location traced and seasons. About 50 % of the trajectories (n = 72) were during the 22nd March
2017 and winter time (23rd November 2017 and 15th January 2018) originating from the North-West
location from a landmass which was a major dust source. Cluster 1 was traversing through the industrial
locations of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for 4 days and settling down at 500 m height
from 2000 m. Air masses in Cluster 1 constituted more than 85 % of total and carcinogenic PAHs in both
PM and PM . Cluster 2 (mainly during monsoon season) which was 33 % of total trajectories
2.5 10
traversed through the south Indian states, Karnataka and Telangana and were below 500 m Above
Ground Level (AGL) and  nally crossed throughout Odisha in the last 2 days before reaching Angul. This
cluster had more impact from south–west monsoon seasonal winds. Cluster 3 (17 %) arrived from the
Bay of Bengal via Indian Ocean during the pre- monsoon on dated 24th May and originated from Indian
Ocean and Arabian Sea. Interestingly, Cluster 2 and 3 together constituted less than 10 % of the total
PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs in both PM and PM . Thus, this cluster was affected mostly by
2.5 10
localized emission sources from 12 hours journey over Odisha. This hypothesis has been further
supported by wind rose showing the exact wind direction (Fig. 2b). Between 4 to 9 % frequency of high-
speed wind were coming between North-West and North. Winds with a speed of 10–15 m/s were coming
from the South and South-West directions. Figure 2c shows Cluster 1, which contributed about one third
of total back trajectories that came from Arabian Sea via Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh during the winter
season and traversed from west and from a height below 500 m AGL.
Over Jharsuguda, wind rose showed 10 m/s to > 15 m/s winds (with 1.6–6.4 % frequency) from the west
(Fig. 2d). Over Jharsuguda, most of the trajectories (Cluster 2) arose from the industrial regions of Indo-
Gangetic plain and we suspect the possibility of long range atmospheric transport from such emission
regions. Thus, this cluster can be associated with a mixer of long-range transport and local pollution
sources mainly from vehicular and industrial sources. Cluster 2 (50 %) was traversing during speci c
dates (21st March, 21st November, 21st December) during winter and pre-monsoon seasons of 2017
originating from north and North-West along the Indo - Gangetic plain (Fig. 2e). These months constituted
nearly 80 to 85 % of total PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs in PM and PM . It originated from the Arabian
2.5 10
Page 10/23
Sea and crossed over the states, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh for 3 days before ending in this sampling
site. Wind rose indicates high wind speed coming from North and North-West directions (Fig. 2b). In 2017,
on 26th May, the 3rd cluster (17 %) originating from south and south-west i.e. the Bay of Bengal and can
be used to track local sources pollution especially from vehicles and local industries. The maximum
transfer of PAHs air parcel was observed during the winter season (November, December) followed by
pre-monsoon (March) over both Angul and Jharsuguda sites. This winter season atmospheric transport
might be caused by western disturbance, which brings the pollutant from industrial areas of Indo-
Gangetic plains to the study area.
3.3. Source apportionment
PAHs can be classi ed by the number of aromatic rings such as two rings (Nap), three rings (Acy, Ace, Flu,
Phe, Ant), four rings (Flt, Pyr, BaA, Chry),  ve rings (BbF, BkF, BaP, DBA) and six rings (InP, BghiP) and this
was used to construct the distribution pattern of the PAHs. Some studies have reported that the low
molecular weight PAHs (LMW, 2–3 ring) mainly exist in the coarse part of the PM (Tan et al., 2011). In
this study, both the high molecular weight PAHs (HMW, 4–6 rings) and LMW PAHs mainly existed in the
 ne particles. During all the seasons 5 ring PAHs was dominant in all the locations (Table S10 & S11).
LMW/HMW ratios of PAHs were in the range of 0.13–0.33, 0.02–0.76, and 0.24–0.9 during summer,
monsoon and post monsoonal seasons respectively. Box-whisker plots representing ring wise distribution
of PAHs in PM and PM among the three seasons in the two major industrial regions of Odisha are
2.5 10
shown in Fig. 3.
PAHs viz. Flu, Pyr ,Chry, BbF, BkF, BaA, BaP, InP and BghiP were classi ed as combustion derived PAHs
( PAHs). The PAHs contributed between 54 to 97 % of the PAHs in PM and 14 to 100 % in
COM COM 16 10
PM respective∑ly. There was a clear difference in post-monsoonal∑ samples from the other seasons and
2.5
some deviations in each sampling site. In monsoon and post- monsoon season, combustion derived
PAHs constituted more than half of the PAHs. Ratio of PAH/ PAH ratios were determined for
16 COM 16
non-catalyst (0.4) and catalyst equipped∑ (0.5) automobiles and for h∑eavy-duty diesel trucks (0.3) (Rogge
et al., 1993). In this study the values of PAH/ PAH varied between 0.74–0.85, 0.53–0.97 and
COM 16
0.52–0.79 during pre-monsoon, monsoon post-m∑onsoonal seasons. Ratio of 0.5 might be from catalyst
equipped automobiles mainly observed in winter season, however, the ratios in other seasons varying
between 0.74 to 0.97 might indicate a complex source. Seven carcinogenic PAHs ( PAHs) are
7carc
another important category for monitoring pollutants in the atmosphere to assess ∑the carcinogenic
potential of PAHs to humans. Mean concentration of PAHs followed the trend as: post-monsoon >
7carc
pre-monsoon > monsoon in both PM and PM acro∑ss industrial regions of Jharsuguda (Table S4) and
2.5 10
Angul (Table S5).
PAHs have been used as tracers to distinguish between diverse sources (Lodovici et al., 2003;
Vasconcellos et al., 2003). For the source apportionment, various diagnostic ratios were combined with
principal component analysis to arrive at a suitable source type for a speci c group of PAHs. Diagnostic
ratios of PAHs are usually an effective way to identify sources because they exhibit the characteristics of
Page 11/23
speci c sources, but they should be used carefully because some of them are variable in different
ambient conditions due to the reactivity of some PAH species, such as the photolytic decomposition of
BaP (Feng et al., 2005; Odabasi et al., 1999). Diagnostic ratio of Flt/(Flt + pyr) (Yunker et al., 2002),
BbF/BkF(Agarwal et al., 2009), BaA/(BaA + Chry)(Ping et al., 2007), BaA/Chry (Wang et al., 2010),
BaP/BgP (Wang et al., 2007) and PAHs / PAHs (Zhang et al., 2006) were used in this study to
7carc 16
understand the speci c source typ∑e. ∑
PC-1: First component represented 52 % of the total variance and was strongly weighted with LMW-PAHs,
such as Nap, Ace and Acy and HMW-PAHs viz. BaA, Chry, BkF, DBA and BgP with best  t > 0.7. Ace, Chry,
BgP(SI Table 16) are reported to be sourced mainly from tra c exhausts emission in India (Cheng et al.,
2013). BaA/(BaA + Chry) ratio has been used to evaluate the contribution of vehicular emissions. Across
all the seasons in both the sites, the mean ratio was observed less than 0.3 indicating catalyst equipped
vehicles (Gogou et al., 1996) as the main vehicular emission source. Nap and Acy might have resulted
from the coal combustion emission. Likewise, BaP and Ace might have resulted from coal and gasoline
emission. This component can therefore represent PAHs sources mainly from vehicular emission.
PC-2: With 17 % variance, this component was mainly loaded with Flu, Ant, Phe, BbF and BaP. HMW PAHs
like four to  ve rings can be signi cantly emitted from light vehicles and Fluoranthene is an indicator for
heavy-duty diesel combustion (Marr et al., 1999). Pyr, BaA, Chry and Fl are markers for coal combustion
(Tavakoly Sany et al., 2014) and BaP for biomass burning (Belis et al., 2011). Flu, Phe, Flt, and Ant could
be from diesel-powered vehicle emissions. Phe/(Phe + Ant) ratio has been used to identify the importance
of petrogenic hydrocarbons in relation to emission from biomass burning. Mean value of Phe/(Phe + Ant)
ratio in both PM and PM in Jharsuguda and Angul across all the seasons were greater than 0.1
2.5 10
indicating petrogenic sources (Table S12 and S13). Mean Flt/(Flt + Pyr) ratio in all the sites across all the
seasons were greater than 0.5 indicating diesel combustion as a major source type. This component can
therefore represent mixed source types due to biomass combustion and petrogenic emission.
PC-3: With 7 % variance, this component was weighted only with InP. Mean value for the ratio of InP/(InP
+ BgP) was 0.5 in both PM and PM in Angul during all the seasons. However in Jharsuguda the
2.5 10
values for this ratio during pre -monsoon was > 0.7 in both PM and PM but in other seasons the ratio
2.5 10
was < 0.3.The ratio between 0.37–0.70 indicate diesel emissions (Kavouras et al., 1999),(Alves et al.,
2017; Pio et al., 2001) and > 0.5 indicates coal, wood combustion (Gogou et al., 1996; Pio et al., 2001).
3.3 Intra-site variation
At different sampling sites in Angul, In PM , PAHs during pre-monsoon followed the trend: A1(Nalco
10 16
Township) > A3(TTPS) > A4(MCL) > A2(Hakim∑pada). During monsoon the trend was as: A1 > A2 > A3 > A4
and during post-monsoon it was A1 > A4 > A3 > A2 in Angul. Similar trend was observed for PAHs in
16
PM across all the seasons. This results strongly suggested that site A1 was the most pol∑luted area
2.5
and this may be due to the impact of vehicular emission of highway and the township near Nalco Smelter
and its captive power plant and proximity to Talcher Thermal power plant and coal mine area. It is to be
Page 12/23
noted that this location is impacted by heavy vehicles and coal mining of Mahanadi coal  eld and
Hakimpada (small industrial area) is the commercial area comprising of small-scale industries and o ce
areas. But in post monsoon A1 (Nalco township) was found to be the most polluted area followed by
MCL, coal mining area, TTPS township near Talcher Thermal power plant area and Hakimpada. Two-way
ANOVA among compounds and sites during all the seasons showed signi cant difference both with
respect to compounds and sites (p < 0.05). Two-way ANOVA among compounds and seasons at
Hakimpada, Angul showed signi cant difference both with respect to compounds and seasons (p < 0.05).
At two different sampling sites in Jharsuguda, PAHs in PM during pre-monsoonal season followed
16 10
the trend Cox colony (B1) > TRL Colony (B2). Hi∑gher concentration of PAHs in Cox colony may be due to
vehicular emission from the nearby Highways and emissions from the surrounding industrial region. In
monsoon the trend was same i.e., Cox colony (B1) > TRL Colony (B2), may be due to vehicular emission
and industrial emissions and during post-monsoon the trend was like TRL Colony (B2) > Cox Colony (B1)
may be due to mining activities in winter season by the local mines at close proximity of the study area.
Two way ANOVA among sixteen PAH compounds across all the seasons at Cox colony showed
signi cant difference with respect to compounds (p < 0.05) and with respect to seasons (p > 0.05). Two-
way ANOVA among compounds and across all the seasons at Belpahar showed signi cant difference
with respect to compounds (p < 0.05,) and signi cant difference with respect to seasons (p < 0.05). Higher
concentration was observed during post-monsoon than the pre-monsoon and monsoonal seasons and
might be possibly related to the lower temperature, weaker radiation strength and more emission sources
(Karar and Gupta, 2006; Valavanidis et al., 2006).
3.4 Risk assessment
3.4.1 TEQs
Toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) of the individual PAHs have been popularly used to calculate their
carcinogenic potential or Benzo(a) pyrene equivalence (BEQ). Comparing the PAHs weight and
7carc
TEFs, low and higher molecular weight PAHs (BaP, DBa, BaA, BbF, BkF, Ind, Ch∑ry and Ant) were the main
carcinogenic components of the 16 priority PAHs. The concentration of those components were quite low
and their ratios were 0–30 %, suggesting the relatively lower human exposure health risk in Angul when
comparing with other cities like 69.4 % of San Paulo city (Bourotte et al., 2005), 51.0 % at Las Condes
during spring, 54.6 % at Providencia and 56.3 % at Las Condes (del Rosario Sienra et al., 2005).
The potential toxicity of the contaminated air samples was evaluated using the toxic BaP equivalent
quotient (TEQ) for seven carcinogenic PAHs. Viz., BaP, BaA, Chysene, BbF, BkF, DBA and InP. Range of
TEQs for total PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs in Jharsuguda (Table S14) and Angul (Table S15) for
different seasons. Figure 4 shows distribution of total PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs for different seasons.
3.4.2 Inhalation Risk
Page 13/23
The estimated LADD values of carcinogenic PAHs in PM2.5 and PM 10 for different age groups are
presented in the Fig. 5. It can be observed from the  gure that during the post monsoon season ILCR was
higher in both PM 2.5 and PM 10 (Fig. 5) across all age groups. Across different seasons and age groups,
ILCR values for daily inhalation and ingestion exposure to PAHs were higher than the values for daily
exposure through dermal contact. This observation was in line with earlier study in South Africa
(Morakinyo et al., 2019a). The risk was highest in children in the age group of 2–4 years. Due to the
higher concentration of PM , the ILCR were higher compared with PM . In our study ILCR ranged
10 2.5
between 10− 5 and 10− 3 representing potential cancer risk to signi cant cancer risk (Wang et al., 2011)
Conclusion
In this study, PAHs concentration at two industrial sites of Odisha were measured in three seasons viz.,
pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoonal seasons during the year 2017-18. Highest mean
concentration of total and carcinogenic PAH was observed in winter season at Angul and Jharsuguda in
Odisha. Five ring structured PAH percentage was dominant in all the seasons and in all the locations.
Mean concentration of PAHs in Jharsuguda was higher than Angul. The qualitative source
16
apportionment presente∑d here indicates that, PC1 represented 52 % of the total variance and was strongly
weighted with LMW-PAHs, such as NaP, Ace and Acy and HMW-PAHs viz. BaA, Chry, BkF, DBA and BgP.
This component represents PAH source from vehicular emission, coal and gasoline emission. PC 2
represented 17 % variance and was mainly loaded with Flu, Ant, Phe, BbF and BaP. HMW PAHs like four to
 ve rings presumably resulted from the emission of light vehicles and Fluoranthene is also an indicator
of heavy-duty diesel combustion. So, this component represents PAH source from heavy duty diesel
combustion, coal combustion and biomass burning. The potential toxicity of the contaminated air
sample was evaluated using the toxic BaP equivalent quotient (TEQ) was higher for Jharsuguda over
Angul. During the post monsoon season ILCR was high in both PM and PM across all age groups.
2.5 10
The risk was highest in children in the age group of 2–4 years. In our study ILCR for both PM and PM
2.5 10
ranged between 10− 5 and 10− 3 representing potential cancer risk to signi cant cancer risk.

results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to
CovidMIP the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04Wm (cid:0)2, which is small compared to the natural year-to-year
variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional
difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change
in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years.
The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of (cid:0) 0.68 to (cid:0) 0.38Wm (cid:0)2 for 2050
relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to (cid:0) 0.25Wm (cid:0)2 compared to the 2050
baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the
CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on
the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sus-
tained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in
2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.

atmosphere-only experiments with EC-Earth3 and estimate the effective
radiative forcing (ERF) of the anthropogenic aerosols in 2020 and 2050

Forster et al. (2020b) developed five new scenarios to explore the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on current and future anthropogenic
emissions. These scenarios are:
• A baseline scenario (base) without any impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and the measures to contain it;
• A two-year-blip scenario (blp) that assumes emissions return to the
baseline scenario after a two-year reduction in emissions due to

2000–2020 from MODIS. COVID-19 economic downturn preferentially supports polluting
fossil-fuel-based economic sectors;

here (Forster et al., 2020a). Evaluating the MACv2-SP approach against
the aerosol optical depth from a complex aerosol-climate model in-
dicates similar regional scaling behaviours (Fiedler et al., 2019b).
Moreover, our MACv2-SP data in CovidMIP models generate results that
fall within the spread from aerosol-climate model simulations with more
complex aerosol treatments (Jones et al., 2021). A complete technical
description of MACv2-SP is given by Stevens et al. (2017). Again pre-
vious data for MACv2-SP did not account for the effect of the pandemic
on anthropogenic emissions. We therefore create here new MACv2-SP
input data, based on the emission data sets for 2015–2050 accounting
for the COVID-19 pandemic and the four recovery scenarios from Forster
et al. (2020b).
For creating the new MACv2-SP data, we scale the anthropogenic
aerosol optical depth and the effect on clouds from 2005 to other years
by multiplying scaling factors in the centre of the nine plumes, marked
in Fig. 3a. Mathematical functions in MACv2-SP use the values in the
plume centers to create the three dimensional distribution of the aerosol
extinction. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the maps of the mid-visible
anthropogenic aerosol optical depth in 2050 from MACv2-SP for three
scenarios that we derive here. Technically, we create annual scaling
factors for each plume center and each year to be represented in MACv2-
SP.
Our method for constructing the scaling factors for MACv2-SP is
similar to the method for the CMIP6 scenarios (Fiedler et al., 2019b).
The anthropogenic aerosol optical depth τ i in each plume center i=1,
…, 9 is scaled with the emission scaling factor Ei for the years t with:
τ i (t)=E i (t)τ i (2005) (1)
We use τ i(2005) at 550nm from Stevens et al. (2017). The scaling factors
Ei(t) are constructed from the anthropogenic emission ε ik of the species k.
These are the gridded emission data for SO2 and NH3 from the emission
data version 4 (Forster et al., 2020b). These emission data are provided
on a longitude-latitude grid with a resolution of 0.5◦×0.5◦(Fig. 2). The
calculation of Ei(t) follows Fiedler et al. (2019a):

details on the application in climate studies is given elsewhere (e.g.,
Fiedler et al., 2017, 2019a; Stevens et al., 2017).
The new MACv2-SP input data are provided as supplementary ma-

It covers the baseline and scenarios that assume recoveries after the
COVID-19 pandemic that intensify the use of fossil fuels, follow a
moderate or strong green pathway, and return to a business as usual
pathway after the assumed two-year interruption by the pandemic in
2020 and 2021.
2.3. Model experiment design
We estimate the ERF of the anthropogenic aerosol reduction in 2020
and the ERF spread associated with the recovery scenarios in 2050 from
the new data. To this end, we perform atmosphere-only simulations with
EC-Earth3 and compute the ERF of the anthropogenic aerosols at the top
of the atmosphere and the surface, i.e., the instantaneous radiative ef-
fects plus the rapid adjustments in the atmosphere.
EC-Earth3 is an Earth system model participating in CMIP6 (Do¨scher
et al., 2021). EC-Earth consists of an atmosphere and land surface model

significant different compared to the baseline. Baseline and the fossil-
fuel based scenarios, however, yield very similar ERFTOA for 2050,
consistent with small differences in τ a and η N for the two scenarios
(Fig. 9a). The ERFSFC for 2050 is more negative than ERFTOA (Fig. 9b)
and has a smaller 95% confidence interval of about±0.04Wm (cid:0) 2
compared to ERFTOA. We therefore find for all scenarios a statistically
significant difference in ERFSFC relative to 2050-base (Table 1).
3.5. Pattern of radiative effects
We assess the spatial distribution of the radiative effects associated
with the anthropogenic aerosols. To this end, we calculate the effective
radiative effects in all-sky (Fall), clear-sky (Fclr), and cloudy-sky (Fcld)
using the relationship:
F all =(1(cid:0) f)F clr +fF cld , (5)
with the total cloud cover (f). Figs. 10 and 11 show the results for the top
of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface.
For 2020, we find some evidence for regionally significant differ-
ences in the radiative effects at TOA associated with anthropogenic
aerosol reductions due to the pandemic. We measure significance at the
95% confidence level. Significant regional signals at TOA are rare, and
primarily limited to Fclr (Fig. 10). This is primarily explained by the
strong variability of clouds. The difference in Fclr at TOA indicates less
negative radiative effects over some regions, e.g., offshore of typically
polluted regions in Asia. This is consistent with the expectation of a more
negative aerosol radiative effect for a given aerosol plume over a dark
ocean surface than over a relatively brighter land surface. Less aerosols
during 2020 therefore coincide with a less negative radiative effect of
anthropogenic aerosols over the ocean than over land, seen as positive
anomaly in Fig. 10. At the surface, the regional differences in the
described radiative effects are more pronounced and spatially further
extended in Fclr, covering large parts in Southeast Asia and East Asia
both over land and ocean, and are also seen in Fall for some regions
(Fig. 10). Surface measurements in these regions could potentially help
to constrain the aerosol effects on climate. Much of the radiative effects
occur over oceans, where the measurement network is typically sparse.

Risk changes
wet, and dry events) in historical period are compared; and the risk changes of compound extremes are discussed
Warm/dry event under global warming 1.5 ◦C and 2 ◦C. Results show that: 1) the Copula approach can describe the joint
Warm/wet event
probability distribution of summer temperature and precipitation in observation and model simulations in most
parts of China except for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; 2) The average risk of warm and wet events in China in-
creases by 2.3 and 1.16 times under 1.5 ◦C warming respectively, increases by 2.83 and 1.29 times under 2 ◦C
warming respectively while the risk of dry events decreases in most parts of China; 3) The average of warm/wet
events in China increases by 5.48 and 10.01 times under 1.5 ◦C and 2 ◦C warming, respectively. Regions over
Northern China and South China experience the most increased risk about more than 8 times. The warm/dry
events show less increase magnitude with 1.82 and 2.04 times under two warming climates, respectively. The
highest increase in risk is mainly located in Northern China. At an additional 0.5 ◦C warming from 1.5 ◦C to 2 ◦C,
the regional average risk of warm/dry and warm/wet events increases by 1.40 and 2.74 times, respectively. In
most areas, the risk of warm/wet events increases significantly and are greater than that of warm/dry events.
This indicates that controlling global warming up to 1.5 ◦C can avoid more intense warm/dry and warm/wet
events. Our work highlights that the risk of compound extremes may be underestimated if we only consider the
univariate events.
1. Introduction Extreme weather and climate events such as hot, drought and flood
are closely related to temperature and precipitation (Hao et al., 2018a,

(Zhai and Pan, 2003; Zhai et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2020). Compared to a temperature in historical periods and found that the occurrence of

Abstract: The study examines spatial and seasonal variations in the air pollution tolerance index (APTI) of four tree species (Ficus religiosa,
Polyalthia longifolia, Syzygium cumini, and Lagerstroemia speciosa) across three sites (industrial, traffic, and natural forest area) in
Bhubaneswar city of Odisha. Significant variations in leaf biochemical parameters (leaf pH, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll, and relative water
content) were observed among species, depending on site conditions and seasons. The calculated APTI value (using four biochemical
parameters) inferred P. longifolia as tolerant (33.97), F. religiosa moderately tolerant (22.07 to 25.46) towards air pollution. Conversely, S.
cumini and L. speciosa showed lower APTI value, indicating their sensitivity to the polluted environment. Irrespective of species, pollution
tolerance was higher in the rainy season than in the winter and summer seasons. Pearson's correlation study revealed that leaf relative water
content and ascorbic acid enhance the tree's defence against pollution-induced oxidative stress. Study suggest P. longifolia and F. religiosa
are best for urban afforestation, avenue plantation, and air pollution control management in Bhubaneswar.

In order to make this report useful for several stakeholders, policymakers, and more importantly for general
citizens, the report guides the reader through the drivers of the problem, its present state, the existing
pressures it has been creating, and the responses taken by the government to mitigate the issue. To
translate the deeply researched narratives into effective and useful policies, the report also stresses on
providing certain key policy suggestions along with introducing the reader to the existing policies.
Recommendations:
Following is a list of all the possible policy recommendations for taking immediate and holistic initiatives
toward improving the air quality of the state:
1. Technological Innovations: There is a clear need to switch from environmentally exploitative
technologies to cheaper and greener alternatives. Some possible technological shifts which could be
adopted by various technological and scientific departments of the State can be:
Evolving cost-effective cleaner technologies,
Adoption of clean energies: solar, wind, and hydro-powered energies,
Encourage clean cooking practices using cleaner fuels such as LPG, biogas, solar, electricity,
and other renewable energy sources to improve indoor air quality.
Energy efficient buildings with minimum dependence on Air Conditioning; Reimagining
housing structures in rural areas with efficient ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality:
Retrofitting these designs into already constructed houses should be considered.
04
2. Promoting climate-smart e-agriculture: Agriculture is a key contributor to toxic air pollutants that further
degrade India’s environment. India should use appropriate technology to reduce its agricultural GHG
pollution- including pollution emerging from crop residue burning (CRB) and livestock- by at least 18 percent
to stay on its Paris Agreement goal of emission reduction and net-zero targets. Considering that CRB
accounts for 17% of PM and 16% of PM air pollution during the winter months in India. Promoting
10 2.5
climate-smart agriculture can turn the wheel in favour of India’s mitigation plans for tackling degrading air
quality.
Direct procurement of Agri-waste by large agro-waste management companies
Incentivize and encourage farmers to explore new markets for selling crop residues for their
alternative usages such as making bedding material for animals, livestock feed, soil mulching, bio-
gas generation, bio-manure/compost, thatching for rural homes, mushroom cultivation, biomass energy
production, fuel for domestic and industrial use.
Encourage an interstate paddy stubble trading model – for example, paddy stubble generated in
the fields of Odisha can be collected and processed in OFPOs and can be traded to northeastern
states where the stubble can be used for edible mushroom cultivation.
Encourage the selling of agri-waste in exchange for fodder for livestock holders.
Innovate technologies that shred paddy markets and convert them into fodder for cattle.
Incentivize climate-smart agricultural models.
The government should introduce Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) for farmers to
abstain from CRB and practice sustainable agriculture.
3. Preparation of afforestation and green cover plans: As per the Department of Environment,
Government of Odisha, about 33% of Odisha’s total geographical area is under forest cover, being a rich
biodiversity hotspot. Forest fires are a large source of PM pollution apart from harming a rich floral and
faunal diversity.
Odisha has also seen a significant reduction in the urban green cover with the rampant felling of trees to
widen roads and the covering of wetlands and marshes to bring real estate projects. Some of the possible 05
policies which can be adopted to make the state’s ULB’s green are:
Undertaking reforestation and afforestation drives along roadsides and medians: It is necessary
to ensure proper maintenance and sustainability of these green covers. This is recommended because
Odisha gets rampaged by severe super-cyclones every monsoon. The government should provide
replantation soon after. This can be done in collaboration with PWD and the National Highway
Authority of India (NHAI). Some other strategies include:
Covering landfills with vegetation,
Vertical gardens on pillars can be encouraged especially on the pillars of over bridges and
flyovers,
Relocation of brick kilns further away from the cities,
Recovering wetlands,
Desilting of drains.
4. Sustainable Urban Mobility: Being a mass contributor to GHGs in the cities, there is an urgent need to
curb vehicular emissions and phase out diesel vehicles by 2025. Following are some policy
recommendations to rethink urban mobility:
Promote bicycle lanes, cycling, and non-motorized transport.
Increase distribution of electric and hybrid vehicles.
Encourage electric two/three wheelers.
Timely technical checking of traffic lights.
Boost last-mile connectivity through clean/ e-Rickshaws.
Issue guidelines for vehicle ownership and usage.
Mandatory scrapping of very old vehicles.
Third-party evaluation and certification of the transport systems need to be adopted.
5. Stringent Planning and Implementation: Action to mitigate air quality requires stringent action plans at
the national and sub-national levels coupled with efficient monitoring mechanisms. State governments and
Boards should enlist immediate tasks as well as future tasks based on priorities and emission goals, inform
policymakers at the state and regional levels, and implement interventions to curb air pollution in the
polluted parts of the city. This would ensure a comprehensive approach to building more sustainable
solutions.
06
6. Industrial planning: Industries are one of the major contributors to toxic chemical pollutants. Hence,
industrial planning in mitigating air pollution should adopt a three-tier approach that takes into account the
revision of emission standards and practices, improve the audit process, and an accuracy-based
bonus payment system to incentivize industrial law enforcement. Some of the other best practices
already adopted in first-world countries can also be replicated in the most polluted metropolitan areas of the
nation.
Encourage the ‘polluters pay’ principle for highly pollutive industries after EIA to prevent, limit
or enforce strict liability for these industries.
Encourage emission trading system, also known as ‘cap and trade’ system: In this system, to
incentivize firms to reduce their emissions, a government sets a cap on the maximum levels of
emissions and creates permits and allowances, for each unit of emissions allowed under the cap. The
currency of trade would be the tonnage of pollutants produced such as CO , NO and SO units.

In order to combat the growing air pollution, NCAP (National Clean Action Plan) is put into action in 2018,
under which all Indian cities have to meet the NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) and the
cities that fail to comply are tagged as “non-attainment” cities.
Out of India’s most polluted states, Odisha is in the 4th position with seven of its cities categorized under the
“Non-attainment” zone, namely Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Balasore, Angul, Rourkela, Kalinganagar, and
Talcher (OSPCB).
Objectives of the Report
This report aims to cater to a plethora of stakeholders such as government bodies, non-governmental
organizations, medical professionals, civil society organizations, youths, and all the citizens of Odisha who
understand the magnitude of this pressing problem of environmental pollution and are willing to take action
to control the rising air pollution. The primary objectives of this report are-
To examine the state of air quality in Odisha,
To identify the sources affecting air pollution and the underlying factors,
To highlight the seasonal variations with respect to the quality of air,
To study the air quality levels during covid and post-covid, and
To study the health hazards of ambient air pollution.

NCAP status for Odisha
NCAP plans:
National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is India’s flagship programme for better air quality in 122 cities,
launched in 2019. NCAP is focused on non-attainment cities in India as they did not meet the national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for the period of 2011-15 under the National Air Quality Monitoring
Program (NAMP).
NCAP Key Priorities:
Each city under NCAP had developed its Action Plan to meet the targets. These could be understood
based on the following key priorities:
Monitoring AQI - NCAP focuses on Monitoring and understanding of air pollution/emission and its
sources led by the PCB’s.
Action to Clean-up Pollution - Cities have taken steps to address the problem once the source has
emitted the pollution/emission.
Mitigating Air Pollution - Cities undertaking steps to ensure elimination of pollution/emission at the
source.
Public Engagement and Awareness - Action undertaken with the objective of engaging the public and
creating awareness.
Targets
The NCAP has set a target of reducing key air pollutants PM and PM (ultra-fine particulate matter) by
10 2.5
20-30% in 2024 taking the pollution levels in 2017 as the base year to improve upon. This is an interim
target as the reduction needed to meet air quality standards in many cities is more than 30%.

Sources of air pollution
17
In Odisha, the major causes of air pollution include fuel burning, household combustion, vehicles, and
industries. Depending on the commercialization of cities, increasing population, and increasing
industrialization, the AQI value fluctuates daily.
Several reforms are adopted by the State Pollution Control Board, Orissa to combat the increase in air
pollution. Recognizing the sources of air pollution was challenging until recent years due to the usage
of manual Air Quality management in various cities of Odisha. Installation of real-time Air Quality
Meters by the Air Quality Monitoring Committee, Government Of Odisha (2018) has widely helped
assess air quality over areas (Odisha Air Quality Monitoring Committee).
Generally, over the years, it has been seen that the sources can be subjective to cities and towns like
Angul and Talcher Industries, coal mines, thermal power plants, and road dust contribute to the
pollution. In Balasore, vehicles are the major cause. In Bhubaneswar, construction tops the list along
with vehicular emissions and road dust.
Compiling data from various pieces of literature and research projects, the major sources of pollution
in Odisha that harm the urban air quality are as follows (OSPCB):

Road dust- Dust from roadsides and industries accumulates and carries toxic substances that come
from multiple sources, proving to be a health hazard. The Angul-Talcher belt is heavily populated due to
roads running through coal mining areas. Expansion of infrastructure (transport, institutional and basic
services), and digging of roads have become common practices promoting the formation of road dust
and wind dust. Poorly paved roads with a lack of vegetation are another reason for the hike (Lin et al.,
2017)
A study conducted on the plants found near industrial areas showed significant effects of air pollution.
Since there are no chemical or mechanical means or devices formulated yet to eradicate air pollution,
nature is the only reliable source. Plants take up heavy metals from the air and use them for metabolic
purposes.
However, the increasing amount of atmospheric pollutants indirectly affects the health of these natural
soldiers too. Samples of roadside plants were used to devise the data and XRF (X-ray fluorescence)
analysis was done that indicated a decrease in leaf area in all plant species growing on roadsides with
heavy traffic and industries.
Vegetation provides a large surface area that acts as a significant sink for air pollutants. Plants can
absorb atmospheric gases without active metabolism, or they can actively metabolize them, creating
concentration gradients that facilitate continued absorption, in most cases, this adversely affects plants.

how hazardous is the air we breathe daily (Das et al., 2022).
Agricultural activities and forest fires- Regional-level pollution also affects the urban air quality to a
great extent. Burning of Agricultural stubble, large-scale open fires, and crop residue burning have a
serious impact. Seasonal and episodic forest fires are another supplier of air pollutants. In Odisha,
during March-April-May, during the rabi harvest season and dry summer, forest fires are evident and
plausible (Satellite images from NASA). The fires become infernos in no time and can impact the urban
air quality of the non-attainment states readily (Lin et al., 2017).
Seasonality and Air Quality:
The Indian sub-continent experiences three major seasons, Summer-Monsoon-Winter. These seasons
provide to boost the Indian economy, but they are also regulators of pollution. It has been seen that the air
quality tends to degrade in summers and winters, because of vehicular movements, mining, and industrial
activities. During monsoons, the air quality becomes ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ due to heavy precipitation and
various meteorological activities, depressions, and cyclones arising in the Bay of Bengal (Panigrahi et al.,
2013).
The North Indian winter smog during early November, starts to engulf the eastern side during late
December and early January. The high local pollution is trapped due to winter inversion and eastern states
like Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha is mostly affected (OB Bureau, 2022).
A recent report (2022) suggests that the peak in PM levels was highest during summer in East India,
2.5
making it the maximum in all regions. It also suggested that this year, the smaller and upcoming cities were
pollution hubs rather than mega cities (CSE, 2022).
Increased modes of transportation, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and crowding of cities have led to
the rise in levels of SPM, RPM, SO , NO , and CO in megacities. These pollutants show an elevation in
2 x
winter than in summer or rainy seasons. Primary air pollutants emitted into the air facilitate the formation of
21
secondary air pollutants as a product of the reactions between two or more pollutants that go on in the
atmosphere. The number of pollutants emitted, and the ability of the atmosphere to disperse or absorb the
pollutants, along with physical and chemical factors and self-purification processes, determine their
concentration in the air.
Vehicle exhausts contain major toxins and pollutants like NO , CO, HC, and PM. The SPM concentration
x
peaks during winters whereas in summers and monsoons, they tend to remain within prescribed limits.
Transportation, industries, and conventional combustion of fuels, roadside dust, and traffic turbulence,
source the emission of RPM (Respirable Particulate Matter). It is observed that the RPM concentration
steadily increases in all three seasons (Ekka et al., 2022).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs- a class of chemicals found naturally in coal, crude oil, and
gasoline) determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were detected in Orissa during
bimonthly (twice a month) sampling of PM and PM , input from industrial areas of the state.
10 2.5
In Orissa, the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons were studied (Ekka et al., 2022) to
detect the concentration of these harmful chemicals in the air and the highest average concentration of
PAHs in PM was observed in the post-monsoon season (170 μg/m 3 ), followed by the pre-monsoon
2.5
season (48 μg/m 3 ) and monsoon (16 μg/m 3 ) period. A similar trend for PAHs was also observed at PM ,
10
with high concentrations observed during the post-monsoon season (286 μg/m3 ), followed by pre-monsoon
season (81 μg/m 3 ) and monsoon season (27 μg/m 3 ).
The main sources of atmospheric PAH pollution in Orissa are burning diesel, gasoline, and coal.
Analysis revealed that PAH concentrations were primarily influenced by air masses originating from the
northwest and passing through central India (Ekka et al., 2022) (OB Bureau, 2022)
Although seasonal variations in pollution are also regulated by many surface-level factors such as vehicular
transportation, operation of mines, thermal power plants, etc., it is devised that winter is the most ‘air
pollution friendly’ season of all.

Insights from the AQI Calendar
The average air quality of Sambalpur, Rourkela, Bhubaneshwar, Cuttack, and Konark is classified as poor.
This is due to the presence of industrial clusters in the districts of Rourkela and Sambalpur. Rourkela is also
popularly known as Ispat Nagar or the steel city of India. It has one of the largest integrated steel plants that
is set up with German collaboration, known as the Rourkela Steel Plant or the Steel Authority of India
Limited (SAIL). India’s first public sector steel plant facility was set up in this city. Industrial emission is the
major source of pollution in this region, followed by vehicular emissions.
According to the data published by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (ospcboard.org), the average
AQI value for November 2022 in Bhubaneshwar is 142, indicating that the air is moderately polluted.
According to the Sameer app, Talcher city, which is 130 km from Bhubaneswar has a moderate AQI, with a
maximum value of 184 on the 6th of November.

Covid-19 and its effect on air pollution
The AQI dropped rapidly during the global lockdown due to COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the
deadly virus SARS-CoV-2 that became the reason for around 60,685,626 deaths in Southeast Asia alone
(WHO). In order to reduce the transmission of infection, the Indian Government confined the entire
population in an unprecedented lockdown, shut large portions of major industries, and brought vehicular
transport to a standstill, which led to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved
the urban air quality. The first case of COVID-19 was detected on the 16th of March 2020 in Odisha,
leading to the implementation of a nationwide lockdown from the 25th of March 2020, thus limiting the
movement of 1.3 billion people in India.
However, essential services like water, electricity, municipalities, hospitals, banks, food stores, and
movement of essential goods trains and trucks were exempted from the lockdown. Despite the lockdown,
steel industries, thermal power plants, production and distribution of fuels like coal, and mining activities, in
and around Odisha were kept operational as ‘essential services, although there was a reduction of
production by 60% due to a fall in the number of workers (Economic times, 2021).
The level of pollution is subjective to rural and urban cities. In general, studies on India reported
decreases in aerosols, NO , SO , CO, CO , and increases in surface ozone (O ) during lockdown
x x 2 3
periods (percentages vary by pollutant and city), the benefits of a cleaner environment due to the
lockdown had been advocated (Paital, 2020).
Keeping in account the pandemic and the drastic changes in lifestyles during and after the
lockdown, did affect the air pollution levels globally. The seven non-attainment states of Odisha
were no exception. Various pollutants significantly rose while others remained the same without
fluctuating and some reduced to non-hazardous levels. For example in Bhubaneswar, it was
expected that air pollution has reduced significantly due to the reduced usage of vehicles and non-
functional industries, but data collected from conducting various studies in different locations of the
city paints a different picture.
On a particular level, the data fluctuates and is subjective to the type of pollutant being talked about.
The study shows that PM and PM increased significantly (rather than decreased), O . increased,
2.5 10 3
and CO and NO decreased during the lockdown period (Sahu et al., 2020). The study was
x
conducted using US EPA-approved analyzers and weather parameters (humidity, solar radiation,
temperature, wind speed, and direction). The values indicated a significant increase of PM (up to
2.5
40.26%) and PM (up to 1.92%) over Bhubaneshwar in 2020, compared to 2019.
10
29
There is a high chance that the operational coal mines during the lockdown period were the major
contributors to the increase of PM values in Bhubaneshwar air. Another factor is the burning of coal
and wood in residential areas since it is a cheap and free energy source. There was hardly any
decrease in the O values either. One thing to be taken into account is that CO and NO are involved
3 x
in O generation/destruction, which shows an alarming decrease during the lockdown period,
3
perhaps this might have affected the accelerating values of surface O over the capital city of
3
Odisha.
As it is known, meteorological conditions play a significant role in reducing or escalating air
pollutants. It was seen that rainfall in the pre-lockdown and the lockdown period, due to depression
in the Bay of Bengal affected the air quality in this region. The Odisha coast was hit by cyclone
“Amphan” on the 20th of May 2020 which changed the picture completely. The coast was washed
off of air pollutants, thereby improving the the quality of air in Odisha.
A significant reduction of primary and secondary pollutants during the lockdown period, as
compared to that of the pre-lockdown period is attributed to the reduced anthropogenic and
vehicular activities across the state. There was more than a 50% reduction in black carbon and a
40% reduction in surface ozone as a result of a combined effect of rainfalls, winds, cyclones, and
the lockdown. On the other hand, CO was hardly impacted by these changing conditions.
Post lockdown or after the ‘unlock’, many cities in India are undergoing repair since the pandemic
and the lockdown crashed the global economy enormously. Odisha is going through significant
development in the construction of roads, residential areas, and shopping malls and advancement in
the usage of anthropogenic methods, to get the cities in the state up and running.
In order to avoid the infection of road, the purchase of vehicles has gone up, people tend to avoid
public transport and around 70% of the population now own personal vehicles, definitely
contributing to the slow decline of the air quality which was repaired to a great extent during the
lockdown. Although there was still a decline in air pollutants recorded during the unlock period,
owing to the meteorology of the onset of the monsoon (Panda et al., 2021).
Health hazards of Air pollution
Air pollution is one of the world's leading causes of death, with the various effects of air pollution
killing approximately 4.2 million people worldwide each year (WHO)
Exposure to fine air pollutants (PM and PM ) leads to diseases related to the heart, lung cancer,
2.5 10
strokes, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and respiratory infection like pneumonia
(WHO).
Long-term and short-term exposure to atmospheric toxins imposes health risks, more severely to
people who are already ill, marginalized groups, elderlies, and children. According to the OSPCB,
30 Bhubaneswar alone records a high number of air pollution-related ailments, primarily lung cancer,
premature deaths of the fetus, and cardiovascular diseases (Odishabytes, 2019).
PM penetrates the respiratory tract via inhalation and becomes a leading cause of pulmonary
infections, cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction,
and Cancer. The ozone layer is naturally designated to protect human life from harmful Ultraviolet
(UV) radiations but the substantial depletion of the layer in the stratosphere is making it easier for UV
rays to penetrate and pose harmful effects at ground level as surface O3 is increasing.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all
considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. CO causes direct poisoning if breathed at
hazardous levels and can lead to chronic intoxication. All the harmful pollutants suspended in the air
are a source of pulmonary ailments like COPD, asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, and cutaneous
diseases too (Manisalidis et al., 2020).
One in 10 persons in the world lives in cities that comply with the WHO air quality standards.
According to the Global Burden of Disease study, more than 1,00,000 (Deccan Herald) premature
deaths per year, attributing to ambient air pollution (Khilnani, Tiwari, 2021). In 2022, about 23 lakh
deaths were recorded.
Out of the total death toll in India, 1.67 million, i.e., 17.8% of deaths were attributed to air pollution in
2019. 0.38 million deaths were caused due to ambient PM air pollution and 0.61 million were due to
household or indoor air pollution. Ambient ozone air pollution solely caused 0.17 million deaths.
Of the total deaths related to air pollution, 39.5% were due to lung diseases (COPD and lung cancer),
24.9% were due to Ischaemic heart disease, 13.7% were due to strokes, 5.5% were due to diabetes
and 1.5% were due to cataract.
Increased mortality due to particulate air pollution reflects increased pollutant emissions due to increased
energy consumption, accelerated urbanization, rapid industrialization, and an increase in fossil-fueled
vehicles. There is evidence that climate change may amplify the negative effects of air pollution through
atmospheric stagnation, temperature-related increases in PM concentrations, and ground-level ozone
2.5
formation, which are particularly acute in India (Global Burden of Disease Study 2019).
In Odisha, the major hazard to health is imposed heart diseases, Lung diseases, and premature deaths
due to the same. An insight into the relation of pollutants with some major diseases is as follows:
Cardio-vascular diseases- Long-term exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen oxides at levels
approaching the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) could prematurely age blood vessels
and contribute to the rapid accumulation of calcium in the coronary arteries. This accumulation of
calcium restricts blood flow to the heart and other major blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of
cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.
31
Using air quality and collected medical data, researchers found a direct relationship between air
pollution and plaque buildup. Long-term exposure to air pollution has accelerated atherosclerosis
cases in healthy people with an increased risk of a heart attack. In fact, researchers found that the
higher the exposure level, the faster the progression of atherosclerosis (USEPA).
There is a significant 0.5% to 1.5% increase in cardiovascular disease for every 5-6 μg/m 3 increase in
PM Furthermore, there is a 69% increase in cardiovascular death after acute exposure to particulate
2.5
air pollution.
Mortality due to cardiovascular disease is
69% vs. respiratory disease 28%
currently. It is also calculated that a 0.68%
increase in cardio-pulmonary mortality was
associated with a 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM.
2.5
on the day before death with a
corresponding increase in hospitalization
relating to ischaemic heart disease and
congestive heart failure.
It is well known that both air pollution and
elevated blood pressure contribute to an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
It is seen that particle exposure was associated with a significant increase in blood pressure.
These studies showed that for every 10.5 μg/m3 increase in PM levels, systolic blood pressure
2.5
(SBP) increased by 2.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased by 2.7 mmHg (Lee
et al., 2014).
Pulmonary and respiratory disorders- SPM and RPM concentrations in and around industrial
sites are higher than in residential areas. Air pollution also affects local residents with respiratory
diseases such as black lung, bronchitis, asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis, as well as many other
diseases such as eye irritation, hypertension, and lung cancer.
Many suspected tuberculosis patients were studied in the Jharsuguda district of Odisha
showing it to be the highest-caused disease due to SPM and RPM from industries in this district
(Swain et al., 2021). Particles less than 10 μm in diameter (PM ) enter the lungs after inhalation
10
and can even enter the bloodstream. Particulate matter, PM , poses a major health risk
10
irrespective of short-term and long-term exposure to PM and was shown to be positively
2.5
associated with acute nasopharyngitis (WHO).
Paradeep, Jagatsinpur is known as one of the most polluted areas in Odisha, according to the
Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI). Air pollutant emissions are responsible for
an estimated 94 deaths annually. Air pollution also leads to emergency room visits due to
32
asthma and lower respiratory infections and lung cancer (CREA, 2021)
Carbon monoxide is produced by fossil fuels during incomplete combustion. Symptoms of
carbon monoxide inhalation poisoning include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea,
vomiting, and eventually unconsciousness.
The affinity of carbon monoxide for
hemoglobin is much greater than that of
oxygen. Therefore, prolonged exposure to
high concentrations of carbon monoxide
can lead to severe poisoning. Hypoxia,
ischemia, and cardiovascular disease are
observed due to the loss of oxygen through
the competitive binding of carbon monoxide
(WHO).
Reproductive health- Odisha is still home to conventional methods of cooking like using coal,
dung, or biogas for cooking purposes. Women are more often exposed to indoor air pollution
where suspended particulate matter can be associated with the detrimental reproductive health
and pregnancies of these women. Even in urban spaces, usage of LPG is not the only mean of
household cooking, many residents accompany it with kerosene stoves too.
Indoor air pollution contributes to the ambient air quality of a region considerably and also
increases outdoor air pollution. From a general perspective, pollutants are responsible for low
birth weight, fetal deaths, and stillbirths along with the acceleration of post partem depression.
Ambient air pollution due to particulate
matter is seen to be associated with low
birth weight and Intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR). Exposure to TSP (Total
Suspended Particle) in the third trimester
was significantly associated with LBW (Low
Birth Weight). Every 10 μg/m 3 increase in
PM increases IUGR risk by approximately
2.5
6-7% after accounting for other risk factors
(Xu et al, 2011). Particulate matter (PM)
pollution is a risk factor for anemia in
women of the reproductive age group (The
Telegraph, 2022).
Increased NO and SO exposure in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy is
2 2
33
associated with an increased risk of IUGR by 16%, 14%, and 16%, respectively. Studies have
reported the impact of various air pollutants such as PM, NO , SO , and CO on PTD (Preterm
X 2
Delivery).
Strikingly, air pollution also adversely affects fertility in men. Gametogenesis in both sexes is
hindered in delivering a number of gametes and in detrimental quantity and effects at the
epigenetic level. Exposure to PM , NO , and O has been regarded to develop erectile
2.5 2 3
dysfunction and decreased libido in men. Further, long-term exposure to atmospheric toxins
increases the risk of damaged sperm production and DNA mutations that might lead to infertility
(Kumar et al., 2021).
Cancer- There is now ample evidence from human and experimental animal studies, as well as
mechanistic evidence, to support a causal link between outdoor air pollution, particularly
outdoor particulate matter (PM), and lung cancer incidence and mortality. Particulate air
pollutions is estimated to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths
worldwide each year.
Epidemiological evidence for outdoor air pollution and the risk of other cancers, such as bladder
and breast cancer, is more limited. Outdoor air pollution may also be associated with reduced
cancer survival, although more research is needed (Turner et al., 2020). Cells with cancer-
causing mutations naturally accumulate with age but are usually inactive. Air pollution awakens
these lung cells, stimulating them to grow and possibly form tumors (Gourd, 2022).
Increased air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, mouth and throat
cancer. New research suggests that pollution is also linked to an increased risk of death from
several other cancers, including breast, liver, and pancreatic cancer (American Association for
Cancer research).
Inhalable particulate pollutants, 2.5 microns in diameter in the air - can cause lung cancer even
in people who have never smoked (Ghosh, 2022) A meta-analysis of studies of NO exposure, a
2
marker of transport-related air pollution, also reported a significant adverse effect on lung
cancer mortality (Gourd, 2022).

Conclusion
35 Indian cities out of the 50 most polluted cities of the world come within this subcontinent's
boundaries. Odisha, similar to other cities in India is becoming a significant victim of air pollution. Out
of India’s most polluted states, Odisha is in the 4th position with seven of its cities falling under the
“non-attainment” zone, namely Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Balasore, Angul, Rourkela, Kalinganagar,
and Talcher.
The Atmospheric Air Quality Management Plan proved to be an adequate solution to accelerate the
prevention of air pollution-related health risks. The public could access it and understand the non-
dimensional AQI of any particular area or region at any given time.
AQI considers the number of pollutants across the globe, preferably PM to measure the overall
2.5
status of air quality. It is seen that air pollution is affected by a number of factors like seasonality,
temporality, pandemics, meteorological factors, and the nature of suspended particles. Odisha sees
varying ranges of air quality over the years but a mean of all the data and research shows a
substantial increase in the state that houses the first smart city of India.
36 Due to increased industrialization and urbanization, ambient air pollution is increasing at a steady
rate, imposing health hazards on the population. The Covid-19 lockdown also affected the air
pollution in Odisha largely, even the period after the lockdown or unlocked period saw an
exponential rise in air toxins and cities were trying to combat the tremendous economic loss faced
during the pandemic.
Air pollution affects all social and cultural groups, and has been a significant cause of the drop in
Indian GDP annually. The government is taking up various initiatives to combat the detrimental
impact of air pollution as the challenges are increasing every day. The government needs to adopt
more policies that need to be cross-sectional, cross-boundaries, and cross-governmental to adopt
an airshed approach towards air pollution abatement. Even the common public needs to take up
first-hand responsibility in helping the government reduce the risks of air pollution.

ANNEXURE:
The NCAP reports of Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar districts of West Bengal are attached in this section-
This policy tracker aims to record air pollution trends and utilize the data in India to paint a picture
of the hazards related to air pollution.
What is NCAP?
The central government formulated and launched National Clean Air Programme on 10 January 2019 to
reduce particulate matter concentration in cities that do not match the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This tracker aims to control air pollution
nationwide through a collaborative approach involving ministers, state governments, local bodies, and
stakeholders for the agenda (NCAP, CPCB).
Clean Air Action Plan for Bhubaneswar
Why is Bhubaneswar under NCAP?
Currently, there are no real-time air quality monitors functioning in Bhubaneswar. There are six
manual stations in Bhubaneswar (OSPCB, 2021).
Manual stations provide data for two days a week reporting on PM , SO , and NO (Clean Air Action
10 2 2
Plan, Bhubaneswar, 2018).
Bhubaneswar has the highest vehicle stock with two-wheelers dominating the fleet (Clean Air Action
Plan, Bhubaneswar, 2018).
Bhubaneswar has the highest number of private cars (Clean Air Action Plan, Bhubaneswar, 2018).
The city needs at least 22 consecutive air monitoring stations to statistically, spatially, and temporally
represent the city's mix of pollution sources and levels (Urban Emissions, 2021).
Open burning of trash is prevalent throughout the city. As cities generate more and more waste with
limited ability to sort and dispose of it, stricter regulations are needed to address the problem (Urban
Emissions, 2021).
There are no official source distribution studies or source inventories to improve the accuracy of
pollution profile assessments in Bhubaneswar (Clean Air Action Plan, Bhubaneswar, 2018).

Monetary aid by the government under the wings of NCAP
The Central government has released a total of ₹74.48 crores for the development of NCAP in Odisha
during 2021-2022, where ₹27.61 crores are solely reserved for the city of Bhubaneswar (PRANA, CPCB,
2022).
The action plan to abate air pollution in Bhubaneswar (Clean Air
Action Plan, Bhubaneswar, 2018)
To set up an adequate number of real-time automatic monitoring stations.
Set up a daily air quality public information dissemination system based on National Air Quality Index
and health advisory.
Immediate implementation of newly devised emissions standards and siting policy for industries.
Encourage industries to adopt clean technologies via the ‘Star rating system’.
Reducing tailpipe emissions through stricter emission standards, stringent emissions inspections, and
phasing out older vehicles.
Reducing urban emissions through improved public and non-motorized transportation systems.
Traffic restrictions that reduce the need to use personal vehicles.
Compact urban planning that reduces travel distances and total vehicle mileage.
42
Replace traditional fuels, especially diesel, with cleaner fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG),
liquefied natural gas (LNG), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Diesel generator sets and roof-top solar programme.
Clean Air Action Plan for Bhubaneswar
Why is Bhubaneswar under NCAP?
Cuttack is identified as one of the non-attainment cities of Odisha.
The main sources of air pollution in Cuttack are vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, and open
burning of solid waste.
A study conducted by the OSPCB in 2019 found that particulate matter (PM) levels in Cuttack were
significantly higher than the national standards, with PM levels being the highest.
2.5
The ambient air quality does not meet NAAQS with respect to PM and PM .
10 2.5
There are only 3 manual monitoring stations in Cuttack.
The manual stations do not monitor all the criteria pollutants as set by the NAAQS.
Air quality data for Cuttack is not available before 2014, as a result, it is not possible to assess the real-
time daily trend that is needed for GRAP implementation.
The government of Odisha has taken some measures to curb air pollution in Cuttack, including the
implementation of graded response action plans, increasing green coverage, and promoting public
transportation. However, more needs to be done to address the issue effectively.

during 2021-2022, where ₹27.61 crores are solely reserved for the city of Cuttack (PRANA, CPCB, 2022).
The action plan to abate air pollution in Cuttack
Two real-time monitoring stations are to be set up in Cuttack (Clean Air Action Plan, Cuttack,
2018).
To implement a graded response action plan, it is important to develop the ability to forecast
pollution. This will require monitoring weather data (Clean Air Action Plan, Cuttack, 2018).
The OSPCB should conduct a source apportionment and emissions inventory study to identify
the sources of pollution and quantify their emissions throughout the seasons (Clean Air Action
Plan, Cuttack, 2018).
A daily air quality public information dissemination system should be established based on the
National Air Quality Index and health advisory (Clean Air Action Plan, Cuttack, 2018).
In addition, the SPCB website should be developed to report daily and annual data for all
pollutants and pollution forecasting, and local media should be used to spread information
(Clean Air Action Plan, Cuttack, 2018).
Research studies, including emission inventories, source apportionment, health impact studies,
exposure impacts, carrying capacity assessment of air shed, regional impacts, hot spot
assessments, and other relevant studies may be conducted to refine and improve the action
plan (Clean Air Action Plan, Cuttack, 2018).
In 2022, the target was revised to reduce PM pollution levels by 40% by 2026 (Urban
Emissions, 2023).

In 2022, the target was revised to reduce PM pollution levels by 40% by 2026 (Urban
Emissions, 2023).
Below are some recommendations and way forward for the NCAP policy tracker-
Recommendations
NCAP needs to be promoted on a larger scale to raise awareness about the boons of the
programme.
Modification of policies and setting up new CAAQMS monitoring stations are necessary.
Non-government bodies and stakeholders need to be motivated to join hands with NCAP.
Way forward
Acknowledgment of the worsening ambient air quality by the state government and stringent
application of laws.
Complying with the policies set by NCAP will help Cuttack to come out of the impending doom
of air pollution.
Increase awareness of the hazards of air pollution amongst the common public to aid the
success of NCAP.

Abstract
The objective of this study is to assess the state of air quality near municipal solid waste dumping site of the smart
city Bhubaneswar, Odisha,India. Air Quality Index (AQI) in the study area has been calculated by measuring
parameters like particulate matter (PM , PM ), sulphur dioxide (SO ), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and
10 2.5 2
carbonmonoxide (CO). Air status from AQI study depicts moderately pollution at dumping site (AQI=51.9).
Corelation study shows a strongly direct relation among AQI and PM (r=0.964). Regression study reflects PM
10 10
is good at predicting AQI (R2=0.93065, p<0.0001). Multiple linear regression (MLR) study predicts AQI with very
less error(rss=0.0003) where PM , PM , SO , NOx and CO are independent variables. This study also identifies
10 2.5 2
potential sources of pollution and the extent of air pollution. In addition, management strategies have been
proposed to minimize the effects of pollutants.

1. Introduction
In the last decades, growing population, urbanization and rising living standards have increased the amount and
diversity of waste produced worldwide (Gidde et al. 2008; Rathi 2007). It is becoming a difficult task for
municipal solid waste management (MSWM) authorities to deal such quantity of solid waste.The indiscriminate
dumping of municipal solid waste is increasing because of governance is poor, environmental awareness is low
and it is not possible to install suitable municipal waste treatment facilities to handle municipal solid waste
(MSW) generated daily in major cities(Rachel et al. 2009). Some researchers from various cities in developing
countries have reported inappropriate handling of municipal solid waste (Mohanty et al. 2014; Das and
Bhattacharya 2013; Noorjahan et al. 2012; Jafari et al. 2010; Chatterjee 2010; Imam et al. 2008; Chung and
Carlos 2008; Berkun et al. 2005). Open dumping of municipal solid wastes is a pre-dominant waste management
option in most developing countries with little regard to the health and environmental impact. There are potential
risks to health and to all component of environment from such solid wastes management practice (Gupta et al.
2007; Rathi 2006; Ray et al. 2005; Sharholy et al. 2005; Jha et al. 2003). These area becoming a source of air
pollution resulting from the decomposition of organic materials and open burning of wastes which pose a threat to
environment by emitting toxic pollutants into the air. Similar type of scenario has seen in developing countries
like India, where rapid industrial growth and population explosion has led people to migrate from villages to
cities, producing thousands of tons of municipal solid waste every day (Gupta et al. 2015). Every city dweller
generates between 350 and 1000 grams of solid waste per day. Indian urban areas produces 188,500 tons of solid
urban waste in a day or 68,8 million tons in a year (Gupta et al. 2015) . It has seen that to deal with such amount
of MSW, the most common practice in developing countries like India is open dumping and few times open
burning at dumping site (Sarkar 2016). This releases immense amounts of air pollutants into the atmosphere,
including particulates, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO ), and dioxins and furans.
2
The Bhubaneswar (BBSR) city is not excluded from this.The city, which was designed earlier for 40,000
people with an area of 16.84 Sq. Km of land is now accommodating about more than 8 lakhs people with an area
of about 135 sq. km. As per provisional reports of Census of India Population of Bhubaneswar in 2011 was
837,737. Presently Bhubaneswar is generating 400 ton per day of MSW. To deal the such amount of MSW,
Bhubaneswar municipality corporation (BMC) has been allotted 61.485 acer of land in village- Bhuasuni in the
year 2008 by Govt. of Odisha. The site is sorrounded by villages: Bhuasuni, Daruthenga, Tulasadeipur,
Jujhagada, Krushnanagar, sunderpada, Chandaka etc. Open dumping is the major activvity i.e.practiced for

Bhubaneswar MSWM (Mohanty et al. 2014). Some time open burning approaches is allso taking place at the
dumping site to deal the huge volume of combustible MSW (Mohanty et al. 2014; Riyan 2018 ) .It may pose
threat to health. As the human health is prone to various diseases such as shortness of breath, sore throat, chest
pain, nausea, asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer due to inhaling of such air quality around the world (Dockery
and Pope 1994, US EPA 1999, Jeff and Hans 2004, Clean Air 2007). It is there fore in this study an attempt has
been made to find out the quality of ambient air in and arround the dumping site with a radious of 10Km.
2. Study area
Bhubaneswar is located between 85°44' E to 85°55' E longitude and 20°12' N to 20°25' N latitude in Khordha
district of Odisha. It is situated in the eastern coastal plains, along the axis of the Eastern Ghats. It has an average
altitude of 45m (148 ft.) above sea level (JNNURM 2013). The city lies on the southwest of the Mahanadi River
and within its delta and forms the northern boundary of Bhubaneswar metropolitan area, where as the MSW
dumping site of BBSR, Bhuasuni is situated north east of Bhubaneswar city and 20 KM from Bhubaneswar
station (Figure 1).The site is geographically located at 200 23’ 30.28”N and 850 47’ 18.20”E at Bhuasuni village
and is covering an area of 61.485 Acres . It is situated in bhuasuni mouza , chandaka of khurda district having
khata no. 232, plot no. 539, 541, 543, 549 and 313. A few villeges near dumping site are Bhuasuni
village ,Daruthenga, Tulasadeipur, Jujhagada, Krushnanagar, Sunderpada, Chandaka etc.
3. Materials and methodology
To determine the ambient air quality in and around the Bhubaneswar municipal solid waste dumping site, an area
of 10 km. radius, monitoring stations were installed and examination of air status has been carried out at 10
locations (L1, L2,L3,L4, L5,L6,L7,L8, L9,L10) given in Table 1, during the year 2015.

The FP sampler SLE- 105 has been used followed by cyclonic and impactor based tech-nique for
measurement of PM and PM respectively. The sampler has been operated at maximum rate of 1.2 m3/min for
10 2.5
collection of PM particle on a preweighed Glass Fiber Filter (GFF) paper, whereas for PM the air sample
10 2.5
has been drawn through Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFE) filter paper at a flow rate of 16.2 L/min. The mass
concentrations of particulate pollutants has been estimated by taking the difference of the final and initial of the
filter paper used for air sampling.
Gaseous pollutants has been collected using the FP sampler SLE-133 having impingers arrangement
(bubbler trains) in series containing absorbents sodium tetrachloromercurate for SO and sodium hydroxide
2
solution for NO . The samples collected in the impinger were stored in ice boxes soon after sampling and
X
transferred to a refrigerator prior to analysis. The samples were analysed spectrophotometrically using West and
Gaeke (1956) method and Jacob and Hocheiser (1958) modified method for analysis of SO and NO
2 X
respectively. For measurement of SO and NO by spectrophotometrically, the used wavelength are 560 and 540
2 X
nm respectively
.
For carbon monoxide monitoring sample of the ambient air has been taken from the sampling tube and
injected into a gas chromatograph where it is routed from one end of the column to the other. During the
movement, the carbon monoxide is converted to methane and the sample is dispensed at different speeds to
eventually separate. The separated components are detected as different peaks in the tracer.
The obtained value of five major air quality parameters (PM , PM , SO , NOx and CO) from air sample
10 2.5 2
analysis has been used to evaluate the quality of air by using Oak Ridge National Air Quality Index (ORNAQI)
given in equation 1 (Bhuyan et al. 2010)and the recorded value of meteorological parameter has been used to
draw winnd rose diagram. Also these data has been used for various statistical analysis like co-relation study,
regression study, multiple regression study to find out the closeness among air quality parameter, meteorological
parameter and that of with calculated AQI. While regression study examines the best approach to predict AQI
with the help of single independent parameter and multiple independent parameter.

4.1.1 Findings from Particulate Matter
Throughout the study period, the concentrations of PM found between minimum value of 38.9 g/m3 to
10
maximum value of 71.3 g/m3. The highest value was found to be 71.3g/m3 at the dumping site and lowest
value was found to be 38.9 g/m3 at the Ramdaspur. While the average values for PM at ten sampling location
10
were found to be varried between 47.15 (at L4) to 61.95 (at L1). While the recorded values for PM varies
2.5
between 24.1 g/m3 (at L5) to maximum value of 41.2 g/m3 (at L1). The average value for PM varries from
2.5
27.95 g/m3 (at L4) to 34.95 g/m3 (at L1). The result indicates that the observed PM and PM value at ten
10 2.5
location are well below the standard as per national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS, 2009). The slight
higher PM and PM values at the MSW dumping site (at L1) has been observed due to local phenomena viz.
10 2.5
unpaved roads, heavy vehicular traffic, burning of MSW and heavy vehicle movement for dumping of MSW.
Though the PM value has increased a little but it is within the permissible limit of NAAQS which is shown in
10
Figure 2a. It is there fore proper management of MSW and frequent sprinkling of water are required to suppress
the emission of these particulate matter.
4.1.2 Findings from NO Pollutant
X
NO found to be minimum of 8.4g/m3 at L5 to highest value of 13.9 g/m3 at L8. These results are well below
X
the NAAQ standard value. Even the average values for NO also staying below the standard. The higher values
X
of NO at different location were may be due to vehicular movemments. The highest and lowest average value
X
for NO was found to be 12.55g/m3 (at L8) and 9.65g/m3 (at L5) respectively.
X
4.1.3 Findings from SO Pollutant
2
SO found to be minimum of 6.8 g/m3 at L4 to maximum of 10.2 g/m3 at L8. While the recorded average
2
values at these ten locations are varried from 7.8 g/m3 at L4 to 8.85 g/m3 at L8. The recorded values are
staying below the standard.
4.1.4 Findings from CO Pollutant
The study shows that CO level in ambient air is also well below the NAAQ standard. The recorded values for
CO were varrying between 271 at L2 to 501 at L7. While the average values for CO at these ten location were
found to be lowest of 310 at L3 to highest of 455 at L7.

The findings from above air quality parameters (PM , PM , SO , NO , CO) has been found bellow the
10 2.5 2 X
NAAQ 2009 standard values which is there in Figure 2a-h. Even the data of all air quality parameters at all

4.2 Results from AQI
Result from AQI from ten sampling location given in Table 3 depict that the ambient air quality is ranging from
light air pollution (LAP) to moderate air pollution (MAP) as shown in Table 4. It has seen that except location
L1and L9, the calculated AQI for rest eight locations are falling in the category of low air pollution (LAP) while
at L1it is falling in the category of moderately (MAP). Even though at locations L2, L3, L7, L8 the quality of air
is LAP but the calculated AQI reveals that the AQI values of these locations are very nearrer to the MAP
category of air quality. The highest AQI of 51.9 is registered at location L1 and next to it the highest AQI value
of 50.62 is observed at L9. The higher values of AQI were expected at these location because of higher values of

correlated with other AQP parameter. The meteorological parameter, relative humidity (RH) is strongly correlated
with CO (r = 0.8112) and is directly proportional. While

r = 0.4364 and 0.3766 respectively. The relationship between particulate matter and relative humidity is found
inversely proportional. The correlation study shows a significant correlation among PM , PM (r=0.768) and
10 2.5
among CO,NO (r=0.507). The tested correlation study between AQI and other observed parameter in Table 5

depicts that AQI is significantly influenced by particulate matter. The correlation coefficient, r=0.964 and 0.858
is found among AQI with PM and PM respectively. Except particulate matter and SO , AQI is negatively

4.4 Findings fom Regression and MLR
In regression study when R2 value is closure to one, the prediction is better (Field, 2009). It can also be explained
as a measure of asociation between the dependent and independent variable (Field, 2009). Regression study in
Table 6 and Figure 3a-h reveals that PM and PM are positively regressed with AQI and are good regressor
10 2.5
towards AQI (Figure 3a) with regression coefficients between them: k = 0.53869 and 0.93223 respectively (Table
6). It is cleared from regression study (Table 6) that PM is best at predicting AQI ( R2= 0.93065, p= <0.0001,
10
rss=4.98). PM is also good at predicting AQI next to PM10 (R2= 0.0.73686, p= 0.00148, rss=18.91). The
2.5
regression study between AQI and meteorological parameter (T, RH, Wind speed) depicts that temprature is good
at at predicting AQI (Figure 3f). While MLR study examines the best equation between dependent parameter
(AQI) and all studied independent air quality parameter (PM , PM , SO , NOx, CO) which is there in Table 6,
10 2.5 2
where the coefficient of determination is found to be, R2=0.9999 and rss=0.0003. From MLR study (Table 6)
values of residuals revealed that the equation in Table 6 is good at predicting WQI for the study area.

4.5 Results from Meteorological Parameter Study
In meteorological parameter, temperature is ranging between 20.1o C (at L1) to 32.2o C (at L5) with average
values ranging from 22.55o C to 31.5o C. While the relative humidity ranges between 50% (at L2) to 86% (at L8)

5. Conclusion
Recorded and analyzed data revealed that all gaseous pollutants are well within the permissible limit at all
locations. But the pollutant Particulate Matter (PM and PM ) are mostly responsible for detarioration of
10 2.5
ambient air quality (AAQ) which is cleared from corelation and regression study. Also the study intelligibly
shows that it would be more appropriate to consider the value of AQI instead of air pollutant content when
planning for prevention of air pollution. Based on the AQI values, it was found that the AAQ value is between
LAP and MAP. It was observed that particulate emission was basically transport related. In order to keep the
PM and PM values within an acceptable limit, it is recommended to grow trees with high dust trapping
10 2.5
efficiency alongside of roads and also water is to be sprinkled continuously at the source of particulate matter
generation. Except these; measures such as limiting the speed of vehicle in vulnerable localities, organizing

public awareness campaigns on the harmful effects of air pollution. Wind rose. A closer examination at the
Bhuasuni dumping site landfill indicates that potentially hazardous foul odors are commonly experienced by
passersby and inhabitants of the community especially those around the landfill. So further study is needed to
address this.

Cerdanya-2017 increase of turbulence and spectral width of precipitation particles. Wind shear layer may promote riming and
aggregation of the ice and snow particles. Two main rainfall regimes are found during the campaign: (1)
stratiform rainfall mostly produced by water vapour deposition processes, although sometimes riming and ag-

Precipitation characteristics at the bottom of the valley show typical continental features such as low Liquid
Water Content, despite the valley is only about 100 km from the sea. This study demonstrates that inner valley
may present distinct precipitation features with respect to windward and leeward precipitation.

The main scientific objective of this paper is to present an analysis of
winter precipitation observations measured in an inner valley, studying
their vertical variability and dominant microphysical processes in order
to expand the current limited literature on the topic. In particular, we
want to assess if the isolation of an inner valley in the Pyrenees Moun-
tains may lead to more continental conditions than expected given the
proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. For this purpose, we carried out a
field campaign at the Cerdanya Valley in the eastern Pyrenees from
December 2016 to April 2017. A dedicated network of non-conventional
meteorological instrumentation was deployed including, among others,
a Micro-Rain Radar and a Parsivel disdrometer. A description of the area
of interest is presented in Section 2 and the instrumentation used in this
study is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results of the
campaign describing the precipitation events (Section 4.1), the vertical
profiles during the snowfall events (Section 4.2), the drop size distri-
bution of the rainfall events (Section 4.3), and the analysis of two
selected case studies (Section 5). Main conclusions and outlook for
future work are described in Section 6.
2. Region of study
The Pyrenees mountain massif is an important ecoregion in south-
western Europe with a high level of biodiversity and endemic species.
From the human perspective, it is a strategic region for energy produc-
tion (Lo´pez-Moreno et al., 2002), tourism (Lasanta et al., 2007) and
water management in north-eastern Spain (Lo´pez-Moreno et al., 2014).

1760 min corresponded to liquid precipitation.
3.3. Micro Rain Radar
Micro Rain Radar (MRR; Peters et al., 2005) manufactured by Metek,
Germany, is a portable meteorological Doppler radar profiler that
operates using a FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave)
scheme in K-band (24.230 GHz). MRR operates transmitting a micro-
wave signal and measuring the backscattered radiation by the falling
particles every 10 s. The Doppler spectra is divided in 32 height bins.
During the C2017 campaign, the MRR was configured to obtain 60-s
averages with a height bins resolution of 100 m. To improve the sensi-
bility of light precipitation and snow typical of winter precipitation and
to avoid aliasing errors produced by ascending movements of small
raindrops and snowflakes, the postprocess scheme developed by Maahn
and Kollias (2012) was applied. This processing has been applied in the
past to study winter and polar storms and precipitation (e.g. Dura´n-

Doppler velocity has been conducted. The phase transition of the hy-
drometeors during rainfall and transition events that occurs at the
melting layer aloft does not allow to systematically observe the vertical
structure of the measured variables during the winter campaign. To
prevent the inhomogeneity of the hydrometeors and their impact on the
profile analysis we used only the measures during snowfall events. This
ensures that changes observed are due only to changes in microphysical
processes and mesoscale or microscale circulations in the inner valley.
Fig. 2 shows the averaged vertical structure of the precipitation
during during snow events in the C2017 campaign. Similar plots were
produced for the whole campaign for rain, mixed and virga events (see
Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information). Reflectivity is related with
both quantity and size of the hydrometeors. A downward increase in the
reflectivity profile typically indicates snow particles growth. Doppler
velocity measures the hydrometeor vertical motions. Snowflakes have a
low terminal velocity, of around 1 m s (cid:0) 1, and allow to trace the vertical
movement of the air using the Doppler velocity measured by radar
profilers such as MRR or similar instruments (Geerts et al., 2011; Gon-
zalez et al., 2019; Toloui et al., 2014). Similarly, the spectral width
associated with solid precipitation particles gives an indication of the
turbulence of the air.

compared the mean values with a selection of different worldwide
studies (Table 3) described in the following subsections.
4.3.1. Properties of the Dm
The mean Dm during C2017 was 1.17 mm with an interquartile range
between 0.94 and 1.35 mm. Values of Dm are characteristic of the
average precipitation in mid-latitudes (Dolan et al., 2018). Those values
are similar to stratiform precipitation in extratropics both in mountain
and in plain or coastal areas where reported values in the literature
examined range from 0.96 to 1.16 mm (Hachani et al., 2017; Ji et al.,
2019; Suh et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2016). Martner et al. (2008), who
studied winter precipitation in mountain coastal areas of California
distinguishing between Bright Band (BB) and Non-Bright Band (NBB)
cases, reported values of 1.25–1.27 mm and 0.73–0.77 mm for BB and
NBB cases, respectively. Those results differ substantially from the
others reported in extratropical areas.
In the tropics, stratiform precipitation presents a larger Dm (1.3 mm)
in tropical mountain slopes of India (Das et al., 2017), but in inner
valleys of the Andean mountains values are enclosed between 0.93 and
1.07 mm, similar than in mid-latitudes (Seidel et al., 2019; Villalobos-
Puma et al., 2020). Indeed, total precipitation in low latitudes present
similar mean Dm than mid-latitudes (Dolan et al., 2018).
Convective precipitation presents larger values of Dm over 1.5 mm
(see for example Casanovas et al., 2021; Das et al., 2017; Suh et al.,

particularly interesting case of heavy snowfall was already investigated
by Gonzalez et al. (2019), illustrating how precipitation profiles and
disdrometric measurements of snow were decoupled from the mountain
induced circulations despite the increased turbulence caused by an at-
mospheric rotor during a mountain wave event. They suggested that
conditions that induce the decoupling are caused by low liquid water
content and lack of dendritic form, that reduced both riming and ag-
gregation. Here, we present a case with transition from snow to rain
occurred between 24 and 25 March 2017, exhibiting an interesting
sequence of different hydrometeors. This event was also studied by
Soula et al. (2021), but focused in the analysis of winter thunderstorms
during C2017. The second case analysed, which occurred at the end of
the campaign on 30 April 2017, shows an early spring transition event
with scattered liquid precipitation.

Pyrenees in the afternoon.
Two soundings were launched during this event. The first one was
released at 12:05 UTC before the front passage and the second at 18:09
UTC when the front was crossing the area of study. Thermodynamic
conditions previous to the front (Fig. S6) showed the presence of a moist
and well-mixed layer more than 3000 m deep over the ground. Sepa-
rated by a stable layer, there was a very dry and almost neutrally
stratified layer above. Satellite images showed the presence of trapped
lee waves before the front caused by this inversion. In the second
sounding inside the front (Fig. 11 and S7), the separation between layers
became suppressed. The front, which was modified at low levels by the
mountains, produced an important moistening and cooling on the
inversion layer. Furthermore, in this layer temperature dropped
strongly. However, at low levels the front barely changed the vertical
temperature profile, and only increased slightly the stratification sta-
bility. Similarly, to the previous case, a single layer with conditional
instable stratification was developed. Wind blew from the WSW at all
tropospheric levels, with small shear at low levels but increasing at
middle and upper levels.

horizontal advection is often neglected yet important for a more thorough understanding of ABL thermody-
namics and kinematics. Here we identified four potentially advection-dominated ABL regimes across (1) the
urban-rural interface, (2) complex terrain and adjacent plains, (3) the land-sea interface where horizontal
transport of marine boundary layer airmasses influences the regional ABL over coastal areas, and (4) frontal
environments where mid-latitude cyclones affect ABL processes via passages of cold and warm frontal bound-
aries. We then introduced a conceptual framework based on observations so that ABL processes are explained not
only by surface forcing but also by horizontal advection of mass, momentum, and energy. This work will help
advance our understanding of ABL processes and single out potential sources that trigger drastic changes in ABL
thermodynamic features including the BLDs under diverse horizontal advection environments.

work is desirable for exploring the relative impact of surface forcing and

The method consists of four major steps: (i) identifying the sources
that significantly impact observed BLD variability on regular basis (e.g.,
EML, MBL, UBL) or during synoptic-scale events (e.g., frontal passage),
(ii) collecting BLD observations at hourly or sub-hourly or with high
time-resolution, (iii) obtaining simultaneous observations of mean
horizontal wind in the ABL, and (iv) investigating the BLD variability as
a function of ABL wind on all timescales. For instance, for a coastal site,
one would classify observed BLD variability into two categories: BLDs Fig. 1. Frequency distribution of the population of US cities with populations
